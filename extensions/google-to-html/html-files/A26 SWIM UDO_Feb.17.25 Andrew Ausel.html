<p><strong>26.9 DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>26.1 PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM)
stream buffer network regulations are to ensure that streams draining
100 or more acres and adjacent lands fulfill their natural functions.
Stream systems are comprised of the stream and their drainage basins.
Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying stormwater and
groundwater to downstream drinking water supplies, storing floodwater,
and supporting aquatic and other life. Vegetated lands adjacent to the
stream in the drainage basin serve as a buffer to protect the stream
system’s ability to fulfill its natural functions. Primary natural
functions of the buffer are to:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Protect water quality by filtering
pollutants.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Provide storage for floodwaters.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Allow streams to meander naturally.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Provide suitable habitats for wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>26.2 APPLICABILITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> All properties shall be subject to the buffer
requirements of this article, except those properties which, as of
November 15, 1999, fit into one of the following categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Lots that have been subdivided by a recorded
subdivision plat approved by the City.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Lots that have been described by metes and bounds
in a recorded deed or shown on a recorded plat, which:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Are residential and one acre or less in size.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Are nonresidential, including mixed-use, and:</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Four acres or less in size if located on a
non-FEMA regulated floodway.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> Seven acres or less in size if located on a FEMA
regulated floodway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Properties on lots recorded prior to November 15,
1999 shall meet the requirements of this article if redevelopment or
expansions to existing structures result in an increase in built-upon
area in the SWIM stream buffer.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The definitions of Section 26.9 only apply to
this article. Unless specifically defined in Section 26.9, other words
or phrases used in this article are as defined in Article 2 for general
definitions or Article 15 for use definitions. In the case of a conflict
between a term defined in Article 2 or Article 15 and this article, the
definition in Section 26.9 controls.</p>
<p><strong>26.3 SWIM WATER QUALITY BUFFER STANDARDS</strong></p>
<p>This article maintains standards for buffers along streams and
waterways to fulfill the purposes of this article. Required SWIM stream
buffer widths are based on the size of the upstream drainage basin.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services shall make all necessary
determinations regarding applicability of SWIM stream buffer
requirements, which are generally depicted by the SWIM Stream Buffer
Map. The SWIM Stream Buffer Map maintained by Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Stormwater Services shall generally depict which streams are subject to
buffer requirements and the related buffer widths. SWIM stream buffer
requirements begin at the point where the stream drains 100 acres or
greater subject to review by field survey on a site-by-site basis.</p>
<p><strong>A. Water Quality Buffer Widths for Streams Draining Equal to
and Greater than 100 Acres</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> SWIM stream buffers are required for streams
draining areas equal to or greater than 100 acres. SWIM stream buffers
are comprised of up to three zones: the stream side zone, managed use
zone, and upland zone. Table 26-1: SWIM Water Quality Buffer Width for
Streams Draining Equal to and Greater than 100 Acres, provides the total
buffer widths and width for each zone, based on the drainage area size.
SWIM stream buffer widths for these streams are measured horizontally on
a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from the top of the
bank on each side of the stream.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Additional buffer standards for drainage areas of ≥ 640
acres:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. The FEMA Flood Fringe Line and Community Encroachment Line, per
Article 27, are used for floodplain and buffer calculations.</p>
<p>b. If the floodplain, per Article 27, is less than 100 feet wide, the
total width of the buffer on that side of the stream shall be 100 feet
except as provided in item d below.</p>
<p>c. The additional buffer area beyond 100 feet shall be parallel to
and contiguous with the required 100 foot buffer and be configured in
such a manner as to benefit surface water quality.</p>
<p>d. So long as the total buffer width is maintained, the buffer may
vary in width on either side of the stream based on individual stream
side topography provided the owner(s) control both sides of the stream
and the stream side zone is maintained on both sides of the stream.</p>
<p>e. Buffer requirements within this section do not apply to the main
channel of the Catawba River including Lake Norman, Mountain Island
Lake, and Lake Wylie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>2</sup> Calculation of the additional 50% area requirement is
based on the area between the FEMA Flood Fringe Line and the 100 foot
SWIM Water Quality Buffer or to the Community Encroachment Line (0.1’),
whichever is less.</p>

</table>
<p><sup>1</sup> When vegetative targets cannot be met, mitigation of
disturbed buffers is required as specified in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Water Quality Buffer Implementation Guidelines when such disturbances
result in the failure of the buffer system to comply with the vegetative
targets specified.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Fill material cannot be brought into the buffer unless
explicitly exempted. Grading is allowed only in the upland zone.
Structures not explicitly exempted above are not allowed in the SWIM
stream buffer. Permitted impacts within the buffer zones should be
coordinated to ensure minimal disturbance of the buffer system. For
example, if it is necessary to install utilities within the buffer,
greenway trails should be constructed to follow the cleared areas to the
maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p><strong>C. Diffuse Flow Requirement</strong></p>
<p>Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the buffer by
dispersing concentrated flow and reestablishing vegetation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Concentrated runoff from ditches or other manmade
conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff enters
the buffer.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse
flow shall be taken by the property owner as necessary to prevent the
formation of erosion gullies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>D. Ponds</strong></p>
<p>Ponds, that intersect a stream, shall have the same buffers as the
original stream measured from the top of the bank of the pond. Buffer
requirements shall not apply to wet ponds used as Stormwater Control
Measures (SCMs). Buffers shall only apply to ponds when the upstream and
downstream stream are considered intermittent or perennial.</p>
<p><strong>E. Additional SWIM Buffer Standards</strong></p>
<p>The following may be located within SWIM water quality buffers when
they meet the minimum requirements of this article and the articles
listed below:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Required open space per Article 16.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. Landscape yard per Article 20.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Amenitized tree areas per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Tree save per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Internal trees per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Perimeter trees per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Water supply water quality buffer per Article
23.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Post-construction water quality buffer per
Article 25.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Floodplain per Article 27.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Areas for greenways or parks per Article 32
offered for dedication and accepted by Mecklenburg County Park and
Recreation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>26.4 REQUIRED BUFFER DELINEATION</strong></p>
<p>The following buffer delineations shall apply:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Streams and buffer boundaries, including all
buffer zones, shall be clearly delineated on all construction plans,
including grading and clearing plans, erosion, drainage and sediment
control plans, and site plans.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Outside buffer boundaries shall be clearly marked
on-site prior to any land-disturbing activities.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Streams and buffer boundaries, including the
delineation of each buffer zone, shall be specified on all surveys and
record plats.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Buffer requirements shall be referenced in
homeowners association documents.</p>
<p><strong>26.5 MITIGATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to set forth the basis on which
mitigation is required for unavoidable or approved buffer impacts within
any of the buffer zones unless otherwise exempted below. This mitigation
basis shall allow the property owner or other entity the opportunity to
disturb a buffer, provided steps are taken to offset the buffer loss.
Prior to any buffer impact, any person or entity seeking approval of a
buffer impact shall submit the requisite site and mitigation information
for approval to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services as specified
below, to the extent approval is required by this article.</p>
<p><strong>B. Buffer Impacts Not Requiring Mitigation</strong></p>
<p>The following buffer impacts do not require mitigation or specific
plan approval but are required to comply with the City’s requirements,
which may be satisfied using designs contained in the current edition of
the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM) and the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services Design Manual for
stabilization of disturbed areas to minimize negative water quality
impacts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Required transportation crossings for
connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Utility crossings.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Parallel water and sewer utility installation as
approved by Charlotte Water.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Public paths and trails parallel to the stream
outside the stream side zone and stream crossings. Pathways shall use
existing and proposed utility alignments or previously cleared areas and
minimize tree cutting to the maximum extent practicable. Pathways shall
preserve existing drainage patterns and avoid drainage structures that
concentrate stormwater to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Incidental drainage improvements/repairs for
maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Individual pedestrian paths connecting homeowners
to the stream in the form of narrow, pervious footpaths with minimal
tree disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> New domesticated animal trails for farming where
existing trails are lost as a result of action beyond the farmer’s
control. Stream crossings should be constructed and maintained to
minimize impacts to the stream side zone with fencing perpendicular and
through the buffer to direct animal movement.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Mitigation approved by a federal or state agency
acting pursuant to Sections 401 or 404 of the Federal Clean Water
Act.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Flood control structures.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Fences that comply with floodplain regulations
(Article 27) and do not require tree removal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Buffer Impacts Requiring Mitigation</strong></p>
<p>Impacts to stream buffers not specified in item B above, proposing to
allow development or other land use in a buffer, shall be required to
mitigate or offset the proposed impact in accordance with this section.
Buffer impacts requiring mitigation and plan approval include, but are
not limited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Filling or piping of streams, regardless of 401
or 404 permitting issued by US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) or NC
Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Clearing of land and/or removal of vegetation
from the stream side or managed use zones other than as specified by
Table 26-2 per the Vegetative Targets of the table.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Paths proposed within the stream side zone.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Stream relocations.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Fences and walls requiring tree removal in the
stream side or managed use zones.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Other buffer impacts not permitted under item B
above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landowner or other entity proposing any of the impacts specified
above shall prepare and submit for approval a site-specific plan to
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. This site plan shall show
the extent of the proposed impact and clearly specify the proposed
mitigation technique.</p>
<p><strong>D. Pre-Approved Mitigation Techniques</strong></p>
<p>The following techniques are available to property owners for
mitigation of buffer impacts upon review and approval of a site-specific
mitigation plan by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services.
Specifications for these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided
in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Water Quality Buffer Implementation
Guidelines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Installation of Stormwater Control Measures
(SCMs)</strong></p>
<p>If not required by another city ordinance or article of this
Ordinance, the installation of an on-site SCM designed to achieve
specified pollutant removal targets will allow for stream buffer impacts
on the specific site. The SCM should remain outside the stream side zone
to the maximum extent practicable. A detailed SCM design plan shall be
submitted to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services for approval
based on specifications and pollutant removal targets contained in the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Stormwater Control Measure Design Manual (SCM
Design Manual). This plan shall also include a long-term maintenance
strategy for the SCM complete with the establishment of adequate
financing to support the proposed maintenance practices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stream Buffer Restoration</strong></p>
<p>The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of
equivalent or greater drainage area, the condition of which is
determined to be qualified for restoration by Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Storm Water Services. This restored buffer area shall be equal or
greater in size than the buffer area to be mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>3. Stream Buffer Preservation</strong></p>
<p>The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at
equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and
convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the City of
Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, or other conservation organization. Staff
may consider other means for preserving these areas on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p><strong>4. Wetlands Preservation</strong></p>
<p>On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed buffer area (two acres of
wetland for each acre of disturbed buffer area), the owner may provide a
combination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with
protective easements.</p>
<p><strong>5. Mitigation Credits</strong></p>
<p>The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing area of
buffer impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as established by
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services shall allow for stream buffer
impacts on the specific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any
other program (i.e., USACE) shall not cover this requirement unless the
issuing agency agrees to relinquish the funds to Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Storm Water Services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>E. Other Mitigation Techniques</strong></p>
<p>No provision of this article shall prevent the creative development
of alternative mitigation plans. The owner shall submit such plan with
proposed buffer impacts and detailed mitigation information to
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services for approval. The criteria
used to judge the acceptability of any alternative plan shall be the
degree to which the plan addresses the preservation of the four primary
natural functions of stream buffers as per Section 26.1. Such plans may
be submitted in conjunction with a mitigation plan submission to the
USACE and NCDEQ for proposed stream or wetland impacts.</p>
<p><strong>F. Posting of Financial Security Required for Stormwater
Control Measures (SCMs)</strong></p>
<p>When SCMs are approved for mitigation of a buffer disturbance, the
approval shall be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of
credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services, in a form which is
satisfactory to the City Attorney, guaranteeing the installation and
maintenance of the required SCMs until the issuance of certificates of
occupancy for 75% of all construction which might reasonably be
anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the SCMs,
allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of
the final plat.</p>
<p>At such time that this level of occupancy is achieved, written notice
thereof shall be given by the owner to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water
Services. The owner shall also verify the adequacy of the maintenance
plan for the SCMs including the necessary financing to support the
proposed maintenance practices. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water
Services will inspect the SCMs and verify the effectiveness of the
maintenance plan and if found satisfactory, will notify the owner in
writing within 30 days of the date of the notice.</p>
<p><strong>26.6 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCMs</strong></p>
<p>Maintenance of all SCMs shall be the responsibility of the property
owner or their designee.</p>
<p><strong>26.7 ADMINISTRATION</strong></p>
