</blockquote>
<p><strong>30.4 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>This section provides general requirements to be used in the design,
review, and approval of any subdivision under the jurisdiction of this
article.</p>
<p><strong>A. Residential Street Design</strong></p>
<p>Residential street design will ensure the creation of a network of
low volume, low speed streets. All new development shall provide for
more than one access for ingress and egress, where feasible. The
proposed street system will extend existing streets on their proper
projections. To the greatest extent practicable, cul-de-sacs and other
permanently dead-end streets are to be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>B. Relationship to Railroad Rights-of-Way</strong></p>
<p>When a subdivision adjoins a railroad right-of-way, the subdivider
may be required to arrange the street pattern to provide for future
grade separation of street and railroad crossings, except where no such
crossing will be allowed by the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Partial Streets</strong></p>
<p>Whenever an existing partial street is adjacent to a tract of land to
be subdivided, the remaining portion of the street shall be platted
within such tract. New partial streets shall meet the standards of
Tables 34-2 and 34-4.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Mature Trees and Natural
Vegetation</strong></p>
<p>Streets and development sites shall be designed to protect and
preserve, to the greatest extent practicable, stands of mature trees and
other areas of significant natural vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>E. Access to Parks, Schools, Greenways</strong></p>
<p>Streets shall be designed, or walkways dedicated, to ensure
convenient access to parks, greenways, playgrounds, educational
facilities, and other places of public assembly.</p>
<p><strong>F. Parallel Streets Along Limited Access Roads and Arterial
Streets</strong></p>
<p>Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a federal or state
highway, limited access road, or arterial that is not a Main Street, the
subdivider may be required to provide a street parallel to the highway
or to utilize reverse frontage on an interior street for lots developed
adjacent to the highway. Where reverse frontage is established, deed
restrictions or other means should be provided to prevent driveways from
having direct access to the highway or street at the rear lot line.</p>
<p><strong>G. Public School and Public Park Sites</strong></p>
<p>When a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy
document as a future public school, public park, or greenway falls
within an area proposed to be subdivided, the Planning Department staff
shall notify the appropriate agency of the proposed subdivision and its
effect on the future public site. The appropriate agency shall decide
within 30 days if it wishes to reserve the site for future
acquisition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If the site is not to be reserved, the
subdivision shall be processed in the normal fashion.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If the agency does wish to reserve the site, the
subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The appropriate agency shall have 18 months from
the date of preliminary plan approval to acquire the site by purchase,
by receipt of a dedication, or by initiating condemnation
proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> If, at the end of the 18 month period, none of
the actions listed above has commenced, the subdivider may consider the
land free of any reservation.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The subdivider may choose to dedicate the area to
be reserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>H.</strong> <strong>Public Facilities</strong></p>
<p>When a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy
document as a future site for any community service facility including,
but not limited to, police and fire stations, libraries, public housing,
or other public use sites, falls within an area proposed to be
subdivided, the Planning Department staff shall notify the appropriate
agency of the proposed subdivision and its effect on the future public
site. The appropriate agency shall decide within 30 days if it wishes to
reserve the site for future acquisition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If the site is not to be reserved, the
subdivision shall be processed in the normal fashion.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If the agency does wish to reserve the site, the
subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The appropriate agency shall have 18 months from
the date of preliminary plan approval to acquire the site by purchase,
by receipt of a dedication, or by initiating condemnation
proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> If, at the end of the 18 month period, none of
the actions listed above has commenced, the subdivider may consider the
land free of any reservation.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The subdivider may choose to dedicate the area to
be reserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I. Street Names</strong></p>
<p>Proposed street names shall not duplicate nor too closely approximate
phonetically the name of any street within the County or City. Where
proposed streets are extensions of existing streets, the existing street
names should be used.</p>
<p><strong>J. Easements</strong></p>
<p>Easements established to the width and in the locations required by
Charlotte Water and Stormwater Services as per the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Storm Water Services Design Manual, the Charlotte Water, Water and Sewer
Design and Construction Standards, and/or the Charlotte Land Development
Standards Manual (CLDSM), as applicable, should be provided for open or
piped storm drainage, sanitary sewers, and water lines. This requirement
applies to such lines installed at the time of the development of the
subdivision and to easements for such lines which may reasonably be
expected to be installed in the future. A sidewalk and utility easement
(SUE) shall be shown two feet off the back of any sidewalk on a public
street or shared-use path located partially or completely outside of the
public right-of-way. If a building is two or more feet behind the
required sidewalk or shared-use path, the two foot space shall be in the
right-of-way, a SUE, or a combination of both.</p>
<p><strong>K. Proposed Water and Sewer System</strong></p>
<p>The preliminary subdivision plan should be accompanied by
satisfactory evidence as to the proposed method of providing potable
water and a system of sanitary sewage collection and disposal as per the
requirements of Sections 34.2 and 34.3.</p>
<p><strong>L. Restrictions on Subdivision of Land Subject to
Flooding</strong></p>
<p>Lots that are subject to flooding should not be established in
subdivisions, except as provided in Section 24.3.C.</p>
<p><strong>M. Lots with Water Access</strong></p>
<p>Where a subdivision which adjoins the Catawba River or its impounded
waters contains interior lots, parcels or tracts of land which do not
adjoin the water's edge, but any part of which is within 450 feet of the
water's edge, one or more lots which adjoin the water's edge shall be
reserved to provide water access for the owners of interior properties.
Such lots shall be called water access lots. If property which is in the
same ownership adjoins the subdivision, such property shall be construed
as being part of the subdivision for purposes of determining
requirements of water access lots.</p>
<p>Water access lots shall equal at least 10% of the area, exclusive of
streets, of all the interior property which lies within 450 feet of the
water’s edge. However, where the 10% would equal less than 20,000 square
feet, the subdivider shall not be required to provide any water access
lots. All water access lots shall have a minimum frontage at the water’s
edge of 100 feet. The water access lots shall either be dedicated to
Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Department (only if the
Mecklenburg County Board of County Commissioners agrees to accept such
dedication) or be transferred in fee simple title to a homeowners
association of the interior lot owners of the subdivision. Before
approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning
Department a covenant stating either that:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> They shall dedicate the required amount of water
access lots to the County; or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> They shall convey title of the water access lots
to a homeowners association of the purchasers of each interior lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the subdivider chooses to dedicate the water access lots to the
County, the Board of County Commissioners shall have agreed to accept
the final responsibility of maintaining the lots, and the preliminary
plan and final plat shall show the dedication. If the title is
transferred to a homeowners association of the interior lot owners, the
preliminary plan and final plat shall designate the lots covered by the
homeowners association for each water access lot.</p>
<p><strong>30.5 SKETCH PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Prior to the filing of an application for approval of a preliminary
subdivision plan, it is strongly encouraged, but not required, that a
sketch plan be submitted to the Planning Department for review and
recommendation. When submitted, this sketch plan should be drawn to a
scale no smaller than one inch equals 100 feet on a topographical survey
and should show, in simple sketch form, the proposed layout of streets,
lots, and other features in relation to existing conditions. It should
include the following information:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The boundary lines of the property being
subdivided.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Watercourses on the land to be subdivided.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The location, names, and right-of-way widths of
any existing streets, paper streets, or half streets on or within 300
feet of the land to be subdivided.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> The location of all property lines which

</blockquote>
<p><strong>G. Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plan</strong></p>
<p>A preliminary plan approved under this article shall be valid for a
period of three years from the date of approval. If no work on the site
in furtherance of the plan has commenced within the three year period,
the preliminary plan approval shall become null and void, and a new
application shall be required to develop the site. If work on the site
in furtherance of the plan has commenced that involves any utility
installations included in the approval or street improvements except
grading, the plan shall remain valid and in force, and the subdivision
may be completed in accordance with the approved plan.</p>
<p><strong>H. Release of Grading Permit</strong></p>
<p>Preliminary plan approval is required for the issuance of a grading
permit for any grading work on the site for the installation of any
improvements in furtherance of the development. The release of the
grading permit may be authorized by the Planning Department staff prior
to the approval of the preliminary plan, if the matters staying the
approval are not related to nor shall influence the need for grading on
the site. Once the preliminary plan is approved, further approvals under
this subsection are not required for granting permits for individual
sites within the development.</p>
<p><strong>30.9 PLATS ALREADY ESTABLISHED BY SURVEY</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Plans for subdivisions of land previously
approved by the City Planning Board or the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Planning Commission, but not recorded by the County Register of Deeds
prior to February 29, 1956, shall be approved for recording without
complying with the requirements of this article if the plat conforms to
the previously approved plan.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Plats already established by survey and recorded
in the office of the County Register of Deeds prior to the effective
date of the Ordinance from which this article derives shall be eligible
for development and other administrative permits without complying with
the requirements of this article, but shall be developed in accordance
with the provisions of the subdivision regulations and/or ordinance in
effect at the time of its approval.</p>
<p><strong>30.10 DRAINAGE</strong></p>
<p>New subdivisions, as defined by this article, shall provide storm
drainage per the requirements of Section 24.3.B.5.</p>
<p><strong>30.11 NO SERVICE UNLESS STREET ACCEPTED OR TENTATIVELY
APPROVED</strong></p>
<p>No department, officer, or employee of the City shall accept for
maintenance, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any streets
or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other
facilities or utilities in any street within the City unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Such street has been accepted or opened as, or
has otherwise received the legal status of, a public street prior to the
effective date of the Ordinance from which this article derives; or</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> For any new street, such street corresponds in
its location and lines with a street shown on a preliminary subdivision
plat, tentatively approved by the Planning Department or
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission; or</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Such street has been accepted as a public street
by a vote of a majority of all the members of the City Council or by the
state; or</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Such street is an approved network-required
private street built in conformance with the provisions of this
Ordinance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>30.12 STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Unless specifically noted, before any final plat
of a subdivision is eligible for final approval, or before any street is
accepted for maintenance by the City or by the NCDOT, minimum
improvements, including drainage and soil erosion, shall have been
completed by the developer and approved by the Planning Department in
accordance with the standards and specifications of the CLDSM or subject
to a performance guarantee in accordance with Section 30.13.C.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> This Ordinance prescribes minimum requirements
for storm drainage and street improvements to be undertaken by the
developer. Satisfactory completion of these improvements, attested by
approval of the Planning Department, shall qualify streets in the City
to be accepted for maintenance by the City and streets in the
extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) to be considered for maintenance by
the NCDOT.</p>
<p><strong>30.13 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> In subdivisions adjoining already established
streets that have been accepted for maintenance by the City or the
NCDOT, the requirements of this section shall apply as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Where the adjoining established street is a part
of the City's or the NCDOT's street system, the adjoining street shall
be improved in accordance with either the requirements of this Part and
the requirements of the City or the NCDOT, whichever establishes the
higher standard.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The requirements of this section are not
applicable for the general removal and reconstruction of established
permanent pavements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Plats for new lots fronting on already dedicated
or established streets that have not been accepted for maintenance by
the City or the NCDOT, or which have been accepted for maintenance by
the NCDOT but have not been improved with a paved roadway, shall be
eligible for final approval when the improvement requirements of this
Part have been complied with as closely as may reasonably be required
considering the existing condition of the street, the extent of area to
be platted and the cost of required improvements in relation to the
comparative benefits to accrue to the subdivider and the other owners of
property on both sides of the street.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Where the improvements required by this article
have not been completed prior to the submission of the final subdivision
plat for approval, the approval of the plat shall be subject to the
owner filing a performance guarantee with the Planning Department. The
amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed 125% of the
reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the performance
guarantee is issued.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> The developer shall have the option to post one
type of a performance guarantee, in lieu of multiple bonds, letters of
credit, or other equivalent security, for all matters related to the
same project requiring performance guarantees. Performance guarantees
associated with erosion control and stormwater control measures are not
subject to the provisions of this section.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> The City, in consultation with other affected
agencies holding performance guarantees for the installation of required
improvements, shall determine the amount of the performance guarantee or
use a cost estimate determined by the developer. The reasonably
estimated cost of completion shall include 100% of the cost for labor
and materials necessary for completion of the required improvements.
Where applicable, the costs shall be based on unit pricing. The
additional 25% allowed under this section includes inflation and all
costs of administration regardless of how such fees or charges are
denominated. The duration of the performance guarantee shall initially
be one year, unless the developer determines that the scope of work for
the required improvements necessitates a longer duration. The amount of
any extension of any performance guarantee shall be determined according
to the procedures for determining the initial guarantee and shall not
exceed 125% of the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the
remaining incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Upon completion of the improvements and the
submission of as-built drawings, as required by this section, written
notice thereof shall be given by the subdivider to the appropriate
department. The Planning Department shall arrange for an inspection of
the improvements and, if found satisfactory, shall, within 30 days of
the date of the notice, provide written acknowledgement to the developer
that the required improvements have been completed and authorize in
writing the release or return of the performance guarantees given.</p>
