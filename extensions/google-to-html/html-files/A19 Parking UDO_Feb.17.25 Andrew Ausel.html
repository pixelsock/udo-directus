</blockquote>
<p><strong>19.1 PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the off-street vehicle and bicycle parking regulations
is to:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Manage parking to meet the intent and context of
the various Place Types, utilizing tools such as minimum vehicle parking
requirements and limits on the maximum amount of vehicle parking to be
provided on-site.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Ensure safe and efficient parking facility
design.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Provide bicycle parking and electric vehicle
infrastructure to implement the City’s goals of increasing the use of
zero carbon energy sources and alternative modes of transportation.</p>
<p><strong>19.2 VEHICLE PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Vehicle Parking Space Tier System</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Table 19-1: Vehicle Parking Requirements are
structured in a three-tier system as follows:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Tier 1: A minimum number of off-street parking
spaces are required. There are no off-street parking space maximums.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Tier 2: A minimum number of off-street parking
spaces are required. There are also off-street parking space
maximums.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Tier 3: A minimum number of off-street parking
spaces are required for a limited number of uses and locations, but most
uses do not have a minimum parking requirement. There are also
off-street parking space maximums.</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Tier 3 required parking minimums may be reduced
or eliminated upon Planning Director approval of a Parking Demand
Management Assessment, as described in the Charlotte Streets Manual.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The tier that is applicable to each zoning
district is identified in Table 19-1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Where a cell is blank and shaded, no minimum
and/or maximum parking is required.</p>
<p><strong>B. Calculation of Vehicle Parking Spaces</strong></p>
<p>Vehicle parking spaces are calculated by the principal use of the
lot. When more than one principal use occupies the same lot, the number
of spaces is the sum of the separate requirements for each principal
use. When one or more accessory uses supports a principal use on the
same lot, the number of parking spaces required for the accessory use,
if applicable, shall be additive to the calculation of the vehicle
parking spaces required for the principal use(s) on the lot.</p>
<p><strong>C. Minimum Off-Street Parking Space Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> When minimum off-street parking spaces are
required by Table 19-1, the minimum vehicle parking requirements apply
when any of the following occurs:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Construction of a new principal or accessory
structure.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Establishment of a new principal or accessory use
conducted primarily outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Expansion of an existing principal structure
resulting in the required addition of 10 or more parking spaces.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Change of use or expansion of an existing use
resulting in the required addition of 10 or more parking spaces.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> For existing parking facilities, the number of
off-street vehicle spaces shall not be reduced below any minimum parking
requirements of this Ordinance. If the number of such existing spaces is
already less than the minimum required, it shall not be further reduced.
However, if required streetscape improvements, curb relocation, or other
requirements of this Ordinance cause the elimination of off-street
parking spaces, these spaces need not be replaced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>D. Minimum Off-Street Parking Space
Flexibilities</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. On-Street Parking Spaces</strong></p>
<p>Existing on-street parking spaces abutting the property may be
counted toward required minimum off-street parking spaces. New on-street
parking spaces abutting the property may also count toward required
minimum off-street parking.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Where on-street parking spaces are unmarked, the
number of parking spaces is calculated by dividing the length of the
on-street parking area abutting the property by the length required for
a parallel parking space in the Charlotte Land Development Standards
Manual (CLDSM).</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Where on-street parking spaces are marked, each
marked space counts as one required parking space, including any space
where at least 50% of the length is abutting the property.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Spaces shall be accessible to the public 24 hours
a day.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> In the event that the city or state removes any
such on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum
required, the existing use will not be required to make up the
difference and the parking will not be made nonconforming.</p>
<p><strong>2. Public Parking Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Development sites located within 1,000 feet walking distance of
public parking facilities may be granted a 20% reduction from the
minimum parking requirement. Public parking facilities shall be owned or
operated by a government agency or municipal service district, or
developed as a public-private partnership, but do not include “park and
ride” facilities for public transit.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Existing Structures or Tree
Preservation</strong></p>
<p>In the event that the required minimum parking spaces cannot be
placed on the lot without the demolition of an existing structure or
causing damage to significant trees on the site or in the public
right-of-way, the Zoning Administrator may authorize up to a 25%
reduction in the total number of minimum parking spaces required on the
lot. In the case of significant trees, the Zoning Administrator shall
consult with the Chief Urban Forester prior to authorization of the
reduction.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The Zoning Administrator may issue such an
authorization only upon the request of the applicant and only upon
determining that the reduction in the number of required parking spaces
will not unreasonably increase parking congestion along public streets
or in parking areas located on nearby lots.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> If such authorization is granted, the applicant
shall not demolish or remove the existing structure or trees unless the
full required number of off-street parking spaces are provided on the
lot.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The Zoning Administrator may request measures be
taken to help mitigate the reduction in parking. These mitigations may
include, but are not limited to, pedestrian connections to public
sidewalks and additional bicycle parking accommodations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>E. Parking Maximum Limitations for Existing
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>In the Transit Oriented Development Zoning Districts and the UC
Zoning District, when at least 50% of the parking lot area is
reconstructed, such parking lot shall meet any required parking
maximums. Resealing, repaving, resurfacing, and/or re-striping of an
existing parking lot are not considered reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>F. Spaces Exempt from Parking Maximums</strong></p>
<p>Spaces reserved for the following are not included in calculating
parking maximums:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Required accessible parking spaces in compliance
with City, state, and federal standards.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> EVSE-Installed​ electric vehicle charging stations
(Section 19.3).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The following pick-up/drop-off spaces, which
shall be marked as reserved:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Ride-hailing service vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Quick-commerce delivery vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Safe exchange zones, such as designated spaces in
public areas for receipt of goods purchased online.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> On-street parking spaces abutting the site.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> On-site visitor spaces for multi-family dwellings
to a maximum exception of ten spaces or 10% of the total number of
on-site dwelling units (in spaces), whichever is greater. All such
spaces shall be marked as available for visitor use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>G. Permissions to Exceed Parking Maximums</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A parking maximum may be exceeded by up to 25% if
one or more of the following are met:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>a.</strong> 10% of the total number of spaces are provided
for public use 24 hours a day and seven days a week.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> 20% of the total number of spaces are provided
for public use as shared spaces available from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> 20% of the total number of spaces are provided
for public use as shared spaces available from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.,
seven days a week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> When public use spaces are provided in order to
exceed a parking maximum, the following apply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>a.</strong> When located within a parking structure, public
use spaces shall be located within the first two floors of the
structure.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Signage shall be provided that indicates the
location of public use spaces.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Shared spaces that are not available 24 hours a
day and seven days a week shall be clearly marked with the hours of
availability for public use.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> The facility may charge for the use of for public
parking spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Public transit facilities shall be exempt from
parking maximums.</p>
<p><strong>H. Alternative Parking Near Existing Transit
Stations</strong></p>
<p>Any property within one-half mile walking distance of an existing
rapid transit station may use the Tier 3 parking standards, unless the
property is located in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type. If Tier 3 parking
standards are used, such standards shall be used in their entirety,
including any applicable parking minimums and maximums.</p>
<p><strong>I. Accessible Spaces</strong></p>
<p>All parking facilities shall comply with City, state, and federal
requirements for accessible parking spaces.</p>

<p><strong>19.3 REQUIRED ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are
required per Table 19-2: Required EV Charging Stations for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Multi-family stacked dwellings</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The residential component of mixed-use
developments</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> For projects with required minimum off-street
parking spaces per Table 19-1, the number of off- street parking spaces
provided is the basis to determine the required number of EV charging
stations as per Table 19-2 below.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> For projects with no required minimum off-street
parking spaces per Table 19-1, the following shall apply:</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Where the number of off-street parking spaces
provided is less than the number of residential units in the mixed-use
development, the number of residential units shall be considered as the
number of provided off-street parking spaces for the purposes of
calculating the EV charging stations required per Table 19-2 below.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> Where the number of off-street parking spaces
provided equals or exceeds the number of residential units in the
mixed-used development, the number of parking spaces provided is the
basis to determine the required number of EV charging stations as per
Table 19-2 below.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Hotels</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Parking lots and parking structures as a
principal use</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> There are two types of electric vehicle (EV)
charging stations required by this article: EV-Capable and
EVSE-Installed. The types of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are
defined in Article 2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Each EVSE-installed space may be counted
as four EV Capable spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C.</strong> In determining the number of required EV charging
stations, when the result contains a fraction, any fraction is counted
as one parking space.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> EV charging stations shall only count toward a
development’s parking maximum if spaces are EV-Capable. EVSE-Installed
stations do not count toward parking maximums.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Where a parking minimum is required,
EVSE-Installed stations shall count as two spaces.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Any EVSE-Installed stations provided in addition
to the required EVSE-Installed stations may be counted toward the
EV-Capable requirement as two EV-Capable stations.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>19.4 REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> When bicycle parking spaces are required by Table
19-3: Bicycle Parking Requirements, such bicycle parking shall be
installed when any of the following occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Construction of a new principal or accessory
structure.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Establishment of a new principal or accessory use
conducted primarily outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Expansion of an existing principal structure
resulting in the required addition of five or more bicycle spaces.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Change of use or expansion of an existing use
resulting in the required addition of five or more bicycle spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Of those uses required to provide bicycle spaces,
Table 19-3 will indicate that some uses are required to provide
long-term spaces. The required number of long-term spaces is a
percentage of the required total bicycle spaces. All other required
bicycle spaces shall be designed as short-term spaces. Where a cell is
blank and shaded, no short-term and/or long-term bicycle parking is
required.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> For uses where bicycle parking is required, a
minimum of two short-term bicycle spaces shall be provided. In no case

facility on a site shall be subject to this standard (ex: 1 pool + 2
tennis courts = 6 spaces)</p>
<p><strong>19.5 DESIGN OF VEHICLE PARKING SPACES</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Each required vehicle parking space shall meet
the minimum dimensional requirements of the Charlotte Land Development
Standards Manual (CLDSM). Each required parking space shall have direct
and unrestricted access to a drive aisle that meets the standards of the
CLDSM.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> For parking lots and parking structures of 20
spaces or more, up to 25% of required vehicle parking spaces may be
designed and designated for compact vehicles per CLDSM standards. Where
EV parking spaces of any category are required, up to 25% of those
spaces may be designed and designated for compact vehicles per CLDSM
standards.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The use of required off-street vehicle parking
spaces for the sale, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any vehicles,
equipment, materials, or supplies is prohibited. The sale and display of
goods in required off-street vehicle parking spaces is also prohibited
unless specifically permitted within the Use Matrix in Article 15.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> For nonresidential uses and multi-family stacked
dwellings, access configurations which require backing directly onto a
street from a required off-street vehicle parking space are
prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>19.6 DESIGN OF SURFACE PARKING AND PARKING LOTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Surface Parking and Parking Lot Location and
Configuration</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts and Neighborhood 2 Zoning
Districts</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. Residential Dwellings</strong></p>
<p><strong>i. Single-Family Dwellings on Individual Lots</strong></p>
<p>The following apply to all single-family dwellings on individual
lots:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Required parking spaces for single-family dwellings shall be
located either on a driveway, on an improved surface parking pad, or in
a garage.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> In a conservation residential development,
required visitor parking shall be located on-street or in a common
parking lot per the requirements of Section 4.5.A.2.a.vii.</p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> All required parking spaces for residential uses
shall be located on the same lot as the use, except for required visitor
parking in a conservation residential development or unless otherwise
allowed in the Ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Duplex, Triplex, and Quadraplex Dwellings on Individual
Lots</strong></p>
<p>The following apply to all duplex, triplex, and quadraplex dwellings
on individual lots:</p>

<p><strong>(D)</strong> Driveways and parking lots shall meet the
standards of Table 19-3.1. The cumulative width of driveways refers to
the area between any part of a street-facing façade and any front lot
line, unless otherwise stated in this Section. For corner lots,
additional driveways and parking lots may be allowed on the side street
but shall not exceed the permitted width as determined by the front lot
width. This maximum width may be split between driveways and parking
lots, but the cumulative width of all driveways and parking lots may not
exceed the maximum width permitted along any applicable street
frontage.</p>

<p><strong>B. Parking Lot Surfacing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> All parking lots shall be improved with a hard
surface, such as concrete, asphalt, or other material commonly used for
the parking of vehicles, but not including grass or dirt; gravel is
permitted in accordance with item 2 below. Pervious paving is encouraged
where appropriate given weight-bearing and traffic requirements.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Gravel and other loose material shall be
permitted for parking lots, with the exception of driveways that connect
directly to a street. Driveways that connect the surface parking lot
directly to a street shall meet the following:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Such driveways shall be improved surfaces, such
as concrete, asphalt, or other material commonly used for the parking of
vehicles, but not including grass, dirt, or gravel.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Improved surface driveways shall be a minimum of
20 feet in length as measured from the right-of-way or back of sidewalk
or a shared use path, whichever is greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Striping</strong></p>
<p>All parking lots improved with a hard surface, excluding those
improved with gravel, of ten or more spaces shall delineate parking
spaces with paint or other permanent materials, which shall be
maintained in clearly visible condition. </p>
<p><strong>D. Barriers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Barriers, such as wheel blocks, bollards, and
curbs, shall be located along the perimeter of parking lots, internal
sidewalks and pedestrian connections that abut parking spaces or
driveways, and vehicle storage areas, except at vehicular, bicycle, and
pedestrian ingress, egress, and circulation points. If there is parking
on the perimeter of a bus or tractor-trailer lot, bollards or wheel
blocks are required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Such barriers shall be designed and located to
prevent parked vehicles from extending beyond designated parking
areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> All barriers shall be designed and located in
accordance with the standards set out in the CLDSM.</p>
<p><strong>E. Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Parking lots shall be subject to the exterior lighting standards of
Section 16.2.</p>
<p><strong>F. Nonconforming Parking Lot and Surface Parking
Design</strong></p>
<p>When an existing parking lot of ten or more spaces does not conform
to the design requirements of this article, it shall be brought into
conformance when the parking lot is fully reconstructed, or the parking
lot area is expanded by greater than 50%. Any expansion of an existing
nonconforming parking lot shall be constructed to all applicable UDO
standards. Resealing, restriping, or resurfacing of an existing parking
lot is considered normal maintenance and incidental repair, and not
reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>19.7 DESIGN OF PARKING STRUCTURES</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Applicability of Parking Structure Design
Standards</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> All parking structures are subject to the general
regulations of item B below.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Select zoning districts are subject to the
additional standards of item C below and Table 19-5: Parking Structure
Design Options when located on the applicable frontage.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> If there is a conflict between the general
regulations in item B and the options outlined in item C, item C shall
control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B. General Parking Structure Design Standards</strong></p>
<p>All parking structures are subject to the following standards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> On the ground floor of a facade abutting a
frontage, where active uses, ingress/egress points, and/or mechanical
equipment are not present, pedestrian-scale interest and activity shall
be created through the inclusion of at least three architectural
elements, such as awnings, overhangs, decorative screens, grills,
louvers, pedestrian scale decorative lighting, decorative plantings, or
other similar features. This does not apply to Limited Access
frontages.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Along a frontage, the facades of parking
structures shall include both vertical and horizontal treatment that
resembles patterns and architecture of the buildings within the
development, including use of similar materials and a similar rhythm of
window openings. Any openings shall be screened using decorative
elements such as grillwork, louvers, green walls, or a similar
treatment. This standard shall also apply to a freestanding parking
structure that is not part of a larger development, in which case it
shall incorporate the patterns and architecture of the surrounding
buildings.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> For parking structures with rooftop open-air
parking, a parapet wall a minimum of four feet in height measured from
the surface of the roof is required.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Facade openings that face any frontage shall be
vertically and horizontally aligned.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Parking structures shall be designed so that
vehicles parked on all levels of the structure and associated lighting
are screened by a wall or panel measuring a minimum of 42 inches in
height, as measured from the finished surface of the parking level.
Along a frontage, the decorative elements indicated in item 2 above
shall occupy a minimum of 25% of the area of the opening above the wall
or panel.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Parking structures shall be subject to the
exterior lighting standards of Section 16.2.</p>

PARKING STRUCTURE DESIGN</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Additional Parking Structure Design Standards by Zoning
District</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Parking structures in select zoning districts
shall be designed in accordance with the additional design standards of
Table 19-5: Parking Structure Design Options.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Where multiple options are indicated in Table
19-5, any of the indicated options are permitted.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Active use spaces and fully wrapped parking
structures are required to meet building articulation and transparency
standards of the zoning district.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Parking structures without active use spaces are
exempt from the following zoning district standards:</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Building articulation standards for minimum
ground floor height and maximum prominent entry spacing.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> Transparency standards.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> The Zoning Administrator may waive the
requirement for ground floor activation for parking structures for
public transit facilities in constrained conditions when Table 19-5 only
allows options with ground floor activation. If such requirements are
waived, the parking structure is subject to the general design standards
of item B above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Parking Structure Design Options</strong></p>
<p>The options of Table 19-5: Parking Structure Design Options are as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>a. Option A – Ground Floor Activation and All Floors
Wrapped</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>i.</strong> All floors wrapped requires a minimum of 70% of
the façade above ground floor along any frontage be covered with
occupiable building space a minimum of 20 feet in depth. This does not
apply for the portion of the facade above the sixth floor.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> Ground floor activation shall meet the standards
of Option C below.</p>
<p><strong>b. Option B – Ground Floor Activation and
Stepback</strong></p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Ground floor activation shall meet the standards
of Option C below.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> A minimum ten foot building stepback is required
for any parking located above the ground floor.</p>
<p><strong>c. Option C – Ground Floor Activation</strong></p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Parking structures shall include residential or
nonresidential active uses along 90% of the ground floor building length
along any primary frontage and 60% of the ground floor building length
along any secondary frontage, excluding areas of vehicular and
pedestrian egress, fire stairs, and mechanical or electrical equipment
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> Nonresidential active use bays shall be a
minimum of 20 feet in width and 20 feet in depth. Individual spaces
shall be furnished with water, sewer, and electrical service, or such
services shall be stubbed into each individual active use bay for a
future connection.</p>
<p><strong>d. Option D – Additional Setback with Landscape
Area</strong></p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Foundation landscape is required along the entire
façade area excluding areas of vehicular and pedestrian egress, and
mechanical or electrical equipment rooms. The landscape yard shall count
toward any required minimum build-to percentage.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> The width of the additional setback is indicated
by the number associated with Option D in Table 19-5. This landscape
area setback is in addition to the setback required by the zoning
district.</p>
<p><strong>iii.</strong> The landscape area shall be planted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 20.8.</p>
