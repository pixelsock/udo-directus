<p><strong>3.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY</strong></p>
<p>Zoning regulations control the use, physical development, and
placement of structures on land within the City of Charlotte and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Regulations are intended to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of all Charlotte residents and those
that provide vital services to the community, and to provide for the
orderly development of land in alignment with the City’s established
land use policies as articulated within the adopted Comprehensive Plan
and other development related policies adopted by the Charlotte City
Council.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 ZONING DISTRICT TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The conventional zoning district classifications in effect before the
effective date of June 1, 2023 of this Ordinance are translated as
shown in Table 3-1: Zoning Districts Translation to the zoning districts
of this Ordinance. The new standards set forth in this Ordinance for
these zoning districts shall apply to all properties within such zoning
districts. </p>

<p><strong>3.4 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP</strong></p>
<h1 id="section"></h1>
<h1 id="a.-location-of-zoning-districts">A. Location of Zoning
Districts</h1>
<p>The location and boundaries of the base and overlay zoning districts
established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map
(“Zoning Map”), as periodically amended. The Zoning Map maintained by
the Planning Department, and all the notations, references, and other
information shown thereon are incorporated into, and made part of, this
Ordinance.</p>
<h1 id="b.-interpretation-of-zoning-map">B. Interpretation of Zoning
Map</h1>
<p>Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning
districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall be used to
interpret the Zoning Map:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Where the Zoning Map shows a boundary line
located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad, or utility line
right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, or other
planimetric feature, it shall be considered to be in the center of the
right-of-way, easement, waterway, or other planimetric feature. If the
actual location of such right-of-way, easement, waterway, or planimetric
feature varies slightly from the location as shown on the Zoning Map,
then the actual location shall control.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Where a map shows a boundary line as being
located a specific distance from a street or alley right-of-way,
railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or
non-navigable waterway, or other planimetric feature, this distance
shall control.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Where a map shows a zoning district boundary to
approximately coincide with a property line or city, town, county or
state border, the property line or city, town, county, or state border
shall be the zoning district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> In instances when an approved rezoning petition
included detailed information regarding a boundary line, such
information shall be used as the correct boundary line location.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Where detailed information regarding a boundary
line is not available, and where a map shows a zoning district boundary
to not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley
right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable
or non-navigable waterway, other planimetric feature, or municipal
border, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall
be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If, because of error or omission in the Zoning
Map, any property within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance is not shown
as being in a zoning district, a zoning district classification of N1-A
shall be established for the property.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> In instances where none of the above methods are
sufficient to resolve the boundary location, the Zoning Administrator
may interpret the reasonable maintenance of a regular boundary to
establish the boundary location.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Interpretation of information on the Zoning Map
will be made by the Zoning Administrator. Appeals of the Zoning
Administrator’s interpretation may be made to the UDO Board of
Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator will evaluate any alleged Zoning
Map error using all available materials and records for the subject and
adjacent properties. These materials include, but are not limited to,
the following:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The tax map, current or historic.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Legal descriptions of properties or
boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Historical zoning maps.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Approved rezoning petition information.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> Tax records, current or historic.</p>
<p><strong>f.</strong> Zoning and special use permit case files.</p>
<p><strong>g.</strong> Official maps from other jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>h.</strong> Topographic and planimetric maps and aerial
photos.</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> Other documentable information from sources whose
accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Lots with Multiple Frontages</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> When a lot has two frontages, at least one
frontage shall be a primary frontage type. If neither frontage meets the
criteria listed for a primary frontage type the longer of the two
frontages shall be designated as an Other – Primary frontage type. If

primary frontages, they shall both be designated as primary
frontages.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> For Uptown Streets, when a lot has two frontages,
at least one frontage shall be a primary frontage type. If neither
frontage meets the criteria listed for a primary frontage type, the
longer of the two frontages shall be designated as an Uptown Primary
frontage type. If both frontages are of equal length, then either of the
two shall be designated as an Uptown Primary frontage type. Parkway and

meets the criteria listed for a primary frontage type, the longest
frontage shall be designated as an Other – Primary frontage. Parkway and
Limited Access frontages shall not be designated as Other - Primary. If
all frontages are Parkway or Limited Access frontages, none shall be
designed Other – Primary. All frontages that meet the criteria for
primary frontages shall be designated as primary frontages.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> For Uptown Streets, when a lot has three
frontages, at least one frontage shall be designated as a primary
frontage type. If no frontage meets the criteria listed for a primary
frontage type, the longest frontage shall be designated as an Uptown
Primary frontage. Parkway and Limited Access frontages shall not be
designated as Uptown Primary. All frontages that meet the criteria for
primary frontages shall be designated as primary frontages.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> When a lot has four or more frontages, at least
two frontages shall be designated as primary frontage types. If less
than two frontages meet the criteria for a primary frontage type, the
longest of those not meeting the criteria shall be designated as an
Other – Primary frontage to meet this minimum. Parkway and Limited
Access frontages shall not be designated as Other - Primary. If all
frontages are Parkway or Limited Access frontages, none shall be
designed Other – Primary. All frontages that meet the criteria for
primary frontages shall be designated as primary frontages.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> For Uptown Streets, when a lot has four or more
frontages, at least two frontages shall be designated as primary
frontage types. If less than two frontages meet the criteria for a
primary frontage type, the longest of those not meeting the criteria
shall be designated as an Uptown Primary frontage to meet this minimum.
Parkway and Limited Access frontages shall not be designated as Uptown
Primary. All frontages that meet the criteria for primary frontages
shall be designated as primary frontages.</p>
</blockquote>
