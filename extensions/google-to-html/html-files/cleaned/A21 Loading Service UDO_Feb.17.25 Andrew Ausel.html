<h2>21.2 DESIGN OF REQUIRED LOADING SPACES</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> A loading space shall be located on the site it
serves, shall not be located within any required setback, and shall be a
minimum size of 10’ by 25’.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Any area required for maneuvering a vehicle
utilizing a loading space shall be of an adequate size and design to
accommodate that maneuverability entirely on the same site as the use it
serves, not on any public right-of-way, network-required private street,
or other site, and shall not be located within any required setback.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> If a parcel has multiple frontages, then exterior
loading spaces or driveway access to loading spaces shall not be located
on a primary frontage. If this requirement creates a public safety issue
or impacts operations, the Zoning Administrator may modify this
requirement or provide an alternative standard. If all frontages are
primary frontages, the Zoning Administrator will determine the frontage
where it shall be located with minimal disruption to vehicles and
pedestrians in the right-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Loading spaces may be located in a surface
parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Loading spaces may be located on the exit portion
of a driveway stem when the driveway has two points of ingress and
egress. Loading spaces shall be located a minimum of 20 feet behind any
required setback and any sidewalk or other pedestrian facilities. The
requirement for two access points may be waived if the loading vehicle
is able to turn around on the site.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Loading space design shall be shown on all site
plans including, but not limited to, loading space location and
dimension, clearance, driveway access to loading spaces, and maneuvering
areas and access aisles.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Loading spaces shall not be utilized for
placement or storage of any large waste or recycling containers.</p>

<h2>21.3 REQUIRED SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING SERVICE
AREAS</h2>
<p>The purpose of the solid waste and recycling service area standards
is to provide safe and convenient access for users and service providers
during the depositing and collection of solid waste and recyclable
materials and to encourage waste reduction. Where the standards of this
section for required solid waste and recycling service areas conflict
with Chapter 10, Chapter 10 of the City Code shall control. In addition
to the standards below, Mecklenburg County has a separate Commercial
Source Separation Ordinance, which may also apply. Nothing herein
prevents the construction of additional solid waste service areas above
the required minimums.</p>
<p><strong>A. Residential Development</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Applicability</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Multi-dwelling developments and multi-family dwellings (stacked and
attached), either as a standalone building or as a component of a
multi-dwelling development, are required to construct on-site space for
each large waste container and each recycling station as required by
this section.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Large Waste Containers</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Spaces for large waste containers shall be required as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Developments of 11 Dwelling Units or Less</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">No space is required to be constructed if a large waste container is
not used for collection. Where any such development does use a large
waste container for collection, the minimum space constructed shall be
large enough to fit an eight cubic yard dumpster-type large waste
container.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Developments of 12 Dwelling Units or More</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The minimum space constructed shall be large enough to fit an eight
cubic yard dumpster-type large waste container per every 30 units or an
eight cubic yard compactor-type large waste container per every 90
units. Large waste containers may be distributed throughout the
development. For developments eligible to utilize a compactor-type large
waste container, nothing in this section shall preclude such development
from utilizing a compactor-type large waste container larger than eight
cubic yards by volume.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Recycling Stations</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The number of residential recycling station
spaces shall be provided in accordance with Table 21-2: Required
Residential Recycling Station Spaces.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Each required residential recycling station
represents space constructed for five 96 gallon carts and is
approximately 144 square feet. Recycling stations may be distributed
throughout the development. However, space constructed for each
individual recycling station shall be a minimum of 144 square feet in
area with a minimum width of 34 inches and accommodate five 96 gallon
carts.</p>

<p><strong>B. Nonresidential Development</strong></p>
<p>If large waste containers and recycling stations are provided within
a nonresidential development, service areas shall be constructed on-site
for each large waste container and each recycling station as
follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Any service area in a nonresidential development
constructed for a large waste container shall be large enough to fit an
eight cubic yard dumpster-type large waste container or compactor-type
large waste container. If more than one large waste container is
provided per this standard (dumpster-type or compactor-type), then the
minimum service area constructed shall be large enough to accommodate
all the large waste containers on the lot. Sufficient space to allow a
collection vehicle to service the container shall be required as per
Section 21.4.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The service area in a nonresidential development
constructed for recycling shall be at least of equal size as the service
area constructed for solid waste containers as required in item 1 above.
Sufficient space to allow a collection vehicle to service the container
shall be required as per Section 21.4.</p>
<h2>21.4 DESIGN OF REQUIRED SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING SERVICE
AREAS</h2>
<p>Where the standards of this section for the design of required solid
waste and recycling service areas conflict with Chapter 10, Chapter 10
of the City Code shall control.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> All large waste container and recycling station
spaces shall be located entirely on the same site as the use it serves
and shall be located a minimum of 25 feet from: 1) any property in a
Neighborhood 1 Place Type or Neighborhood 2 Place Type; 2) public
streets; and 3) network-required private streets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Solid waste and recycling service areas may be
located on the exit portion of a driveway stem when the driveway or the
development has two points of ingress and egress. Container placement
shall be located a minimum of 20 feet behind any required setback and
any sidewalk or other pedestrian facilities. See illustration example in
Section 21.2<strong>.</strong> The requirement for two access points may
be waived if the loading vehicle is able to turn around on the site.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> If a parcel has multiple frontages, large waste
container and recycling station spaces located outside shall not be
located on a primary frontage. If this requirement creates a public
safety issue or impacts operations, the Zoning Administrator may modify
this requirement or provide an alternative standard. If all frontages
are primary frontages, the Zoning Administrator will determine the
frontage where it shall be located with minimal disruption to vehicles
and pedestrians in the right-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Any area required for maneuvering a vehicle for
the collection of waste containers and recycling stations shall be of an
adequate size and design to accommodate that maneuverability entirely on
the same site as the use it serves, and not on any public right-of-way,
network-required private street, or other site, and shall not be located
within any required setback.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Solid waste service vehicle maneuvering areas are
allowed to back-up within the site when maneuvering, but shall not
encroach into the setback, sidewalk, or public right-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> The CDOT Director, in consultation with the Solid
Waste Director, may modify the requirement for providing required
on-site maneuvering space for large waste containers and/or recycling
stations and the containers may be located on-street for pick-up for
multi-family developments that either do not provide on-site parking or
provide all parking within a parking structure, under the following
scenarios:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Multi-family developments of 50 units or less
where all the following conditions are met:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The collection containers shall not obstruct
vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic. Sidewalks shall remain
unobstructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The collection containers shall be removed from
their on-street collection location and returned to the building or
structure on the same day of collection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The collection containers are serviced from a
collector or local street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The site is located in an IC-2, RC, IMU, NC,
CAC-1, CAC-2, RAC, UE, UC, TOD-CC, TOD-NC, or TOD-UC Zoning District
where all the following conditions are met:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The standards of items 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c above
are met.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> It shall be demonstrated that on-site collection
cannot be provided due to site constraints or unusual circumstances.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> It shall be demonstrated that Section 21.4.A.1
cannot be reasonably accommodated on the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> If the street does not already include
curb-to-curb dimensions of a collector or office/commercial wide street,
the curb shall be moved to reflect the office/commercial wide
cross-section along the affected frontage. If the exception listed in
Section 32.7.C.3.b.iii applies and the curb-to-curb dimension cannot be
provided, the exception shall not apply.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> On-street collection spaces shall be clearly
marked and designed to prevent intrusion into adjacent parking
spaces.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Solid waste service and maneuvering areas shall
be shown on all site plans. Information to be provided shall include,
but is not limited to, service area locations and dimensions, any
required height clearance, driveway access to service areas, and
maneuvering areas and access aisles.</p>
