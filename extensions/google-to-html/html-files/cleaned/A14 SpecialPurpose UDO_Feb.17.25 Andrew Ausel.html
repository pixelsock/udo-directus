<h2>14.1 HDO HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY</h2>
<p><strong>A. Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the HDO Historic District Overlay is to establish
local historic districts to encourage the restoration, preservation,
rehabilitation, and conservation of historically, architecturally, and
archaeologically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, and
objects and their surroundings from potentially adverse influences which
may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of important
historical, architectural, and archaeological features, which are a part
of the City's heritage, and to review new construction design to ensure
compatibility with the character of the district.</p>
<p><strong>B. Applicability</strong></p>
<p>The HDO Historic District Overlay is applied as an overlay zoning
district which will supersede other zoning districts with respect to
compatibility, context, and appropriateness of exterior features as
described in item E below within a designated local historic district.
An HDO Historic District Overlay cannot be applied in combination with
any of the following: HDO-S Streetside Historic District Overlay, NCO
Neighborhood Character Overlay, and RIO Residential Infill Overlay.</p>
<p><strong>C. Designation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Historic District Overlays shall consist of areas
that are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history,
architecture and/or culture and to possess integrity of design, setting,
materials, feeling and association. The area, buildings, structures,
sites, or objects shall be significant elements of the cultural, social,
economic, political, or architectural history of the City or of the
archaeological history or prehistory of the City and the conservation of
such a district will provide for the education, pleasure, and
enhancement of the quality of life of all residents of the City.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The Historic District Commission (HDC) shall make
an investigation and report on the historical, architectural, or
archaeological significance of the buildings, structures, features,
sites, objects, or surroundings included in a proposed district, and
prepare a description of the boundaries of the district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> The North Carolina Department of Natural and
Cultural Resources, or an agent or employee designated by its Secretary,
shall make an analysis of, and recommendations concerning, this report
and description of proposed boundaries in accordance with state law.
Failure of the Department to submit its written analysis and
recommendations to the City Council within 30 calendar days after a
written request for such analysis has been mailed to the Department
shall relieve the City of any responsibility for awaiting such an
analysis, and the City Council may at any time thereafter take any
necessary action.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> With respect to any changes in the boundaries of
such district subsequent to its initial establishment or the creation of
additional districts within the City, the investigative studies and
reports shall be prepared by the Historic District Commission. Changes
in the boundaries of an initial district or proposals for additional
districts shall also be submitted to the Department of Natural and
Cultural Resources in accordance with the provisions stated above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> The City Council shall designate the boundaries
of a new HDO or change in boundary to an HDO in accordance with
procedures set forth in Section 37.2 for amending the Zoning Map.</p>
<p><strong>D. Certificate of Appropriateness Required</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> No exterior portion of any building or other
structure, including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and
pavement, or other appurtenant features, above-ground utility
structures, any type of outdoor advertising sign, or important landscape
and natural features may be erected, altered, restored, moved, or
demolished within an HDO until after the property owner, or his/her
designated agent, has contacted the Historic District Commission staff
to determine whether the project will require a Certificate of
Appropriateness (COA).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> When a Certificate of Appropriateness is
required, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be
submitted and work may not begin until the Certificate of
Appropriateness has been issued. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall
be issued by the Historic District Commission prior to the issuance of a
building permit or other permit granted, for the purposes of
constructing, altering, moving, or demolishing structures. A Certificate
of Appropriateness is required whether or not a building permit is
required.</p>
<p><strong>E. Exterior Features</strong></p>
<p>Exterior features include the architectural style, general design,
and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other
structure, including the kind and texture of the building materials, the
size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows,
doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the
case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features mean the style,
material, size, and location of all such signs. Exterior features may
also include color and important landscape and natural features of the
area.</p>
<p><strong>F. Minor Works</strong></p>
<p>The Historic District Commission has the authority to delegate to
their professional staff approval of certain types of minor works
consistent with the detailed standards approved by the Historic District
Commission. Minor works do not involve substantial alterations,
additions, or removals that could impair the integrity of the property
and/or the district as a whole or would be incongruous with the special
character of the district. Staff shall not deny a request for a
Certificate of Appropriateness. All applications where it cannot be
determined that the action is a minor work or where the application may
be incongruous with the special character of the district shall be
submitted to the Historic District Commission.</p>
<p><strong>G. Interior Arrangement</strong></p>
<p>The Historic District Commission has no jurisdiction over interior
spaces, unless the arrangement of interior features directly affects the
integrity of the exterior of the property and, therefore, would be
incongruous with the special character of the district as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>H. Ordinary Maintenance and Emergency Repair</strong></p>
<p>Nothing in these provisions shall be construed to prevent the
ordinary maintenance, repair, or removal of any exterior feature in a
historic district which does not involve a change in design, material,
or outer appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature that a
Building Inspector or similar official shall certify is required for
public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. In the event
of an emergency, Historic District Commission staff may authorize the
immediate restoration of any exterior feature to pre-disaster
conditions. Historic District Commission staff shall be consulted and/or
the feature shall be well documented photographically and such
documentation shall be made available to the Historic District
Commission for its files, if appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>I. Restoration or Repair of Historic Features</strong></p>
<p>The Zoning Administrator in consultation with the Historic District
Commission Administrator may administratively approve the restoration or
replacement of an historic feature necessitated in the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties as defined
by the National Park Service (Secretary’s Standards) if the feature
would encroach into a required setback or required landscape yard that
is not permitted by this Ordinance. Restoration or replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.</p>
<p><strong>J. Demolition or Removal</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> After the designation of a historic district, no
building or structure located in that district shall be demolished or
otherwise removed until the owner of the property has applied for a
Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition or removal. If the
Historic District Commission determines that the property does not have
special significance and value toward maintaining the character of the
historic district because of age, architectural style, associative
history, designation as a local historic landmark, listed as a
contributing building in the National Register of Historic Places, or
structural condition, the Historic District Commission may grant a
Certificate of Appropriateness for the immediate demolition or removal
of the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> If the property is determined by the Historic
District Commission to have special significance and value toward
maintaining the character of the district, the Historic District
Commission may delay demolition or removal for no more than 365 days
from the date of the approval. During this 365 day period, the Historic
District Commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other
parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> An application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building, structure, or
site within the district may not be denied. The maximum period of delay
authorized by this section shall be reduced by the Historic District
Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship
or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such
property by virtue of the delay. If the Historic District Commission
finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of
such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> If the Commission has voted to recommend
designation of an area as an Historic District and final designation has
not been made by City Council, the demolition or destruction of any
building, site, or structure located in the proposed district may be
delayed by the HDC for a period of up to 180 days or until City Council
takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. Should
City Council approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180
day delay period, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
for demolition shall then be filed. The maximum period of delay for a
Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition shall be reduced by the
HDC by the period of delay while the designation was pending.</p>
<p><strong>K. Compliance with Other Applicable Laws</strong></p>
<p>If site plans have been submitted that are not in compliance with
this Ordinance or other identified state or local laws, then the
Certificate of Appropriateness or any permits or certificates issued by
the City may be revoked.</p>
<p>An applicant shall submit site plans that are in compliance with this
Ordinance and with any other state or local laws designated by the
Historic District Commission. If the Historic District Commission staff
or the Historic District Commission determines that submitted site plans
are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other state or local laws
designated by the Historic District Commission, then the Historic
District Commission staff or Historic District Commission shall not be
required to proceed to review the application for the Certificate of
Appropriateness until site plans have been submitted that are in
accordance with this Ordinance and applicable state or local laws. If
site plans have been submitted that are not in compliance with this
Ordinance or other identified state or local laws, then the Certificate
of Appropriateness or any permits or certificates issued by the City may
be revoked.</p>
<p><strong>L. Certificate of Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Historic District Commission has jurisdiction over the review,
approval, and issuance of Certificates of Appropriateness for the
exterior features of all properties and for the demolition or removal of
any building or structure within a historic district as per this Section
14.1.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Review Standards</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> In considering an application for a Certificate

maintaining a pedestrian scale and orientation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The Historic District Commission shall apply the
Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation (See 36 Code of
Federal Regulations Section 67.7). (Hereinafter: Secretary's Standards),
and the Historic District Design Standards adopted by the Historic
District Commission. Approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness by the
Historic District Commission should not be interpreted as approval for
any other process, such as state or federal tax incentives.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Application</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The applicant has the responsibility to submit an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness that is accurate, complete, and
accompanied by sufficient information to fully depict the proposed
development, alteration, rehabilitation, relocation, restoration, or
demolition. A fee, as applicable, shall be provided to the Historic
District Commission staff. If the applicant fails to submit a complete
application and any required fee, then the application shall not be
submitted for review to the Historic District Commission until the
deficient requirements have been met to the satisfaction of the Historic
District Commission staff.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Submission of Site Plan Compliance</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">An applicant shall submit site plans that are in compliance with this
Ordinance and with any other local or State laws designated by the
Historic District Commission. If the Historic District Commission staff
or the Historic District Commission determines that submitted site plans
are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other State or local laws
designated by the Historic District Commission, then the Historic
District Commission staff or Historic District Commission shall not be
required to proceed to review the application for the Certificate of
Appropriateness until site plans have been submitted that are in
accordance with this Ordinance and applicable state or local laws.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Evidentiary Hearing Notice</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Historic District Commission staff shall follow the requirements
for evidentiary hearing notice in Section 37.8.A.9 to inform the
applicant, property owner if different from the applicant, and abutting

Commission shall be open to the public in accordance with the North
Carolina open meetings law.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> In all proceedings or public hearings before the
Historic District Commission with regard to an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, the burden of providing competent,
material, and substantial evidence is upon the applicant and if the
applicant fails to do so, the Historic District Commission shall deny
the Certificate of Appropriateness.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Notwithstanding other provisions of this
Ordinance, the Historic District Commission may require additional
evidence or memoranda of authority to be submitted and may take the
matter under advisement until such evidence or memoranda has been
submitted and considered up to the 180 day limit.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Duration of Certificate of Appropriateness</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be valid
for 12 months from the date of issuance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> If a building permit is required, failure to
procure a building permit within 12 months from the date of issuance
shall be considered a failure to comply with the Certificate of
Appropriateness and the Certificate of Appropriateness shall expire. The
Certificate of Appropriateness may be renewed for an additional 12
months by staff upon written request of the applicant, before the permit
expires in order to procure a building permit.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> If a building permit is not required, the

<p><strong>M. Appeals</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> An appeal in the nature of certiorari may be
taken by any aggrieved party to the Mecklenburg County Superior Court
from the Historic District Commission's action granting or denying the

160D-406(k) is filed, then the petitioner must order from the court
reporter and pay for the original transcript of the hearing for delivery
to the clerk of the Historic District Commission for the preparation of

<p><strong>N.</strong> <strong>Violations and Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>The Zoning Administrator enforces Section 14.1 in accordance with
Section 39.2.L. Failure to comply with these provisions constitutes a
violation subject to enforcement action. Violations include but are not
limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Performing any work (including erecting,
altering, restoring, moving, and/or demolishing any building, structure,
private street, private sidewalk, site area or object) that requires a
Certificate of Appropriateness without first obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> A Certificate of Appropriateness is denied and
the project is carried out in defiance of the denial.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Work is approved and a Certificate of
Appropriateness is issued and the work is carried out in a manner
inconsistent with the approval.</p>
<p><strong>O. Notices of Violation</strong></p>
<p>The Zoning Administrator enforces Section 14.1, in accordance with
Section 39.2.L.2.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Upon recognition of a violation, a notice of
violation will be issued by the Zoning Administrator to the property
owner. A notice of violation shall identify the nature of the violation,
contain the address or other description of the site upon which the
violation occurred or is occurring, and shall set forth the measures
necessary to achieve compliance with this Ordinance. The notice shall
inform the property owner whether a civil penalty shall be assessed or
shall specify a date by which the property owner shall comply. If a
violation continues or is not corrected within the time specified in the
notification, appropriate action may be taken to correct and abate the
violation and will subject that property owner to civil penalties and
other authorized enforcement action. Each day’s continuing violation
shall be a separate and distinct offense and may be subject to any one,
all, or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this
Ordinance in accordance with Section 39.2.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The notice of violation shall be delivered to the

electronic delivery, or first-class mail and may be provided by similar
means to the occupant of the property or the person undertaking the work
or activity. The notice of violation may be posted on the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The person providing the notice of violation shall certify to the
City that the notice was provided, and the certificate shall be deemed
conclusive in the absence of fraud.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> The property owner will have 30 days to either
correct the violation or appeal the citation to the UDO Board of
Adjustment through the Board’s appeal procedure. If the property owner
corrects the violation, no further action will be taken. If the property
owner, in the opinion the Historic District Commission staff, is making
a good faith effort to bring the violation into compliance, further
enforcement action can be held in abeyance as long as that effort is
continuing.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> A notice of violation may be appealed. An appeal
stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines
assessed during the pendency of the appeal.</p>

<p>The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue citations and
penalties, in accordance with Section 39.2.L.3.</p>

designated as a historic landmark or located within a designated
historic district is about to be demolished whether as the result of
deliberate neglect or otherwise, materially altered, remodeled, removed,
or destroyed, except in compliance with the development regulations in
Section 14.1, or other provisions of this Ordinance, the City, the
Historic District Commission, or other party aggrieved by such action
may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such
unlawful demolition, destruction, material alteration, remodeling, or
removal, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, or to prevent
any illegal act or conduct with respect to such building, structure,
site, area, or object. Such remedies shall be in addition to any others
authorized by the City for a violation of the Ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>S. Revocation of Building Permit</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental
Services Agency, on its own authority or as directed by the Planning
Director, shall revoke and require the return of any building permit by
notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason for the
revocation. The revocation process shall follow the same review and
approval process required for issuance of the permit. The revocation of
a permit by administrative staff may be appealed in accordance with
Section 37.8.B.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Building permits shall be revoked for any
substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements
of a Certificate of Appropriateness, or any applicable State or local

the Planning Director, shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy or
Certificate of Compliance unless there has been compliance with any
Certificate of Appropriateness issued by the Historic District
Commission. Compliance with a Certificate of Appropriateness shall
