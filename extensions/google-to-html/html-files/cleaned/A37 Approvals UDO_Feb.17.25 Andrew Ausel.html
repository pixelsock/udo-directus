Petitions</strong></p>
<p>If a decision on a proposed Ordinance amendment has not been reached
within two years from the submittal date of the petition, the petition

<h2>37.2 ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to provide a means for amending the
zoning district designation of any parcel of land identified on the
Official Zoning Map.</p>
<p><strong>B. Authority</strong></p>
<p>The City Council shall have the authority to amend the district
designation of any parcel of land, as indicated on the Official Zoning
Map.</p>
<p><strong>C. Types of Zoning Map Amendments</strong></p>
<p>Applications for a zoning map amendment fall into three
categories:</p>
<p><strong>1. Conventional Zoning Map Amendment</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A conventional zoning map amendment is a legislative process in which
an applicant proposes changing the zoning district designation on a
property or group of properties to a conventional zoning district, and
the City Council considers whether to approve or deny the zoning map
amendment. Conventional zoning districts allow a variety of uses
permitted under the development standards of the zoning district.</p>
<p><strong>2. Conditional Zoning Map Amendment</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A conditional zoning map amendment is a legislative process in which
a petitioner proposes, and the City Council considers, a zoning map
amendment to a conditional zoning district that may include a site plan
and/or individualized additional site-specific commitments.
Site-specific conditions may also be proposed by the petitioner or the
City, but only those site-specific conditions approved by the City and
consented to by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the
petition. Site-specific conditions shall be limited to those that
address the conformance of the development and use of the site, per the
Ordinance regulations, or the impacts reasonably expected to be
generated by the development or use of the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Exception (EX) District Zoning Map Amendment</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Purpose</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">An exception (EX) district zoning map amendment is also considered a
conditional zoning map amendment. An exception (EX) district zoning map
amendment is a legislative process for altering or modifying certain
select quantitative zoning standards, select qualitative zoning
standards for certain uses, and street cross-section standards for
proposed development; however, the standards cannot be waived in their
entirety. Altering or modifying permitted land uses through an exception
(EX) district zoning map amendment shall not be permitted. It provides a
mechanism for City Council to review and consider new development
concepts, innovative designs, special problems, and other unique
proposals or circumstances that cannot be accommodated by the standards
of a zoning district, while addressing the conformance of the
development and use of the site to other applicable standards, the
Comprehensive Plan, and/or the impacts reasonably expected to be
generated by the development or use of the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Applicable Standards</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Altering or modifying permitted land uses through an exception (EX)
district zoning map amendment shall not be permitted. An exception (EX)
zoning map amendment shall only modify the following standards:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The quantitative zoning standards, subject to the
additional exception(s) and limitation(s) below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> No modifications shall be made to maximum height
regulations, with the exception of the height transition limitations
when adjacent to the Neighborhood 1 Place Type.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> For Convention Center, Public Transit Facility,
and Stadium uses, the number of required prominent entrances may be
reduced to one.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The qualitative standards for Convention Center,
Public Transit Facility, and Stadium uses as identified below:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> For the façades of a parking structure not
located on a Main Street frontage, the utilization of design option D
per Section 19.7.C.2.d.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> For signage: (1) allow a master sign program per
Section 22.11.B even if a site does not meet size or development
thresholds, and (2) allow deviations from the zoning district sign
regulations for a site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> Surface parking, driveways, circulation, and
maneuvering may be reconfigured on site but the cumulative area of these
shall not be increased in size. These areas may be located in the
established setback, but not the required setback, if approved through
an exception (EX) zoning map amendment. The standards of Table 19-4
shall otherwise apply.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> For stadiums, the upper floor transparency and
upper floor maximum blank wall area standards of an applicable zoning
district may not apply when: (1) the applicable wall area(s) are at
least 50' above the ground floor, (2) the shape or design of a stadium
does not allow the requirements to be met, (3) strict adherence to the
requirements would serve no meaningful purpose, and (4) approved through
an exception (EX) zoning map amendment.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The street cross-section standards.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Districts Allowed</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The establishment of an exception (EX) district is allowed in the
following districts:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> In the following Transit Oriented Development

<p><strong>H. Scheduling of Public Hearing</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The Planning Department staff shall schedule a

been met and after there has been adequate time for staff of the
Planning Department and other City and County departments and agencies
to review and provide comment on the proposed amendment.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Before approving a zoning map amendment, a
legislative public hearing by the City Council is required. A notice of
the hearing shall be given once a week for two successive calendar weeks
in a newspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall
be published the first time not less than ten days nor more than 25 days

be mailed a notice of the hearing on a proposed zoning map amendment by
first-class mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the
Mecklenburg County tax abstract. The notice shall be deposited in the
mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Published Notice</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Zoning Map Amendment</strong> <strong>Notice</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A notice of the legislative hearing shall be given once a week for
two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general circulation
in the area. The notice shall be published the first time not less than
ten days nor more than 25 days before the date scheduled for the
hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be
included but the day of the hearing shall be included.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Optional Notice for Large-Scale Zoning
Map Amendments</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The first-class mail notice required under item 1 above is not
required if the zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning
designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different
property owners, and the City elects to use the expanded published
notice provided for in this section. The City may elect to make the
mailed notice provided for in item 1 above or, as an alternative, elect
to publish notice of the hearing as required by N.C.G.S. § 160D-602(b),
provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a
newspaper page in size. The advertisement is effective only for property
owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper
that publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the

according to the provisions of item a above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Posted Notice</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A notice of the hearing shall be prominently posted on the site
proposed for the zoning map amendment or on an adjacent street or
highway right-of-way. The notice shall be posted within the same time
period specified for mailed notices of the hearing. When multiple
parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting
on each individual parcel is not required but the City shall post
sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested
persons.</p>
<p><strong>J.</strong> <strong>Legislative Public Hearing</strong></p>
<p>The legislative public hearing shall be conducted by the City Council
and shall be in accordance with any rules and procedures adopted by the
City Council.</p>
<p><strong>K.</strong> <strong>Referral to Planning Commission and
Recommendation from the Planning Commission</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> After the public hearing and prior to the

submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation.
Hereinafter, any reference to the Planning Committee shall include any
applicable committee of the Planning Commission per the Interlocal
Agreement between the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The Planning Commission shall review the proposed
zoning map amendment. The review shall consider the zoning evaluation
criteria in Sections 37.2.L, 37.2.M, and 37.2.N, as applicable. Upon
completion of the review, the Planning Commission shall make a written
recommendation regarding adoption of the amendment to the City
Council.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> The recommendation from the Planning Commission
shall include a written statement of plan consistency. The statement
shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan and any other adopted plan or policies that
are applicable. A statement by the Planning Commission that a proposed
amendment is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan or other
applicable plans or policies shall not preclude consideration or
approval of the proposed amendment by City Council.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If no written recommendation and statement of
plan consistency is received from the Planning Commission within 30 days
of the public hearing, the City Council may act on the amendment without
the Planning Commission recommendation. If the Planning Commission does
not make a recommendation within 30 days after the petition has been
referred to it, then the Planning Commission shall be considered to have
made a favorable recommendation, unless action was taken to defer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> The City Council is not bound by the
recommendation, if any, of the Planning Commission.</p>

rezoning hearings and decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Planning Department staff shall forward the
Planning Commission, or the applicable committee of the Planning
Commission, written recommendation and statement of consistency for the
zoning map amendment to the City Council, along with an updated staff
review and recommendation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> If any person submits a written statement
regarding a proposed zoning map amendment to the City Clerk at least two
business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposed amendment, the
City Clerk shall deliver such written statement to the City Council
members before action is taken.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Prior to a City Council decision, the petitioner
for any conditional, including an exception (EX) district, zoning map
amendment, shall agree in writing to the conditions submitted for the
proposed map amendment.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> The City Council shall review the proposed zoning

<p><strong>P. Conditional Zoning Approval in a City General Election
Year</strong></p>
<p>The City Council may not vote on a zoning map amendment to a
conditional zoning district during the time period beginning on the date
of a municipal general election and concluding on the date immediately
following the date on which the City Council holds its organizational

<p><strong>Q. Withdrawal of Modification of Pending Zoning Map Amendment
Petition</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Withdrawal</strong></p>
<p>A request to withdraw a proposed zoning map amendment shall be made

withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>2. Modification</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> A petitioner shall not be allowed to modify a
proposed zoning map amendment after a public hearing has been scheduled
unless such modification(s) are submitted to the UDO Administrator no

potential modifications proposed by the petitioner, Planning Commission,
City Council, and other interested parties may be considered by the City
Council at the time of the hearing, if offered.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> If modification to the petition is proposed by
the petitioner after the public hearing, and before the Planning
Commission recommendation, the Planning Commission shall evaluate
whether a modification is substantial enough to recommend another public
hearing, and make a recommendation to the City Council.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>. If the Planning Commission does not recommend
another public hearing of a modified petition, it may defer action on
the petition to a set date in order for staff and other interested
parties to have the opportunity to review and comment on the amendment
to the petition.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> If the Planning Commission recommends that the
modified petition move forward without recommending a deferral or new
public hearing, the Planning Commission shall consider the revised
petition and forward its recommendation to the City Council.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> If a modification to the petition is proposed by

recommends a new public hearing for a modified petition, this
recommendation shall be provided to the City Council at the next
scheduled City Council meeting for rezoning hearings and decisions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>g.</strong> Even if the Planning Commission or Planning staff
does not recommend a new public hearing, the City Council may, at its
discretion, schedule the modified petition for a new public hearing,
preceded by the notice required in Section 37.2.I.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>h.</strong> If the petitioner wishes to modify the proposed
zoning map amendment after the Planning Commission’s recommendation and
prior to a vote by the City Council, then prior to the time of the vote,
the City Council shall refer the modified petition to the Planning
Commission for a new review and a potentially updated recommendation
unless the City Council, by a three-fourths vote of all members present,
except members properly excused from voting, determines that the nature
of the modification is such that the Planning Commission review and
potential updated recommendation is not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>R. Effect of Approval and Denial of Zoning Map
Amendment</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Effect of Approval</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If a petition for zoning map amendment to a conditional zoning,
including an exception (EX) district, is approved, the development and
use of the property shall be governed by the requirements of the zoning
regulations in place at the time of the zoning map amendment approval,
as well as any site plan and/or site-specific conditions of the approved
conditional zoning district.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Effect of Denial</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A petition for a zoning map amendment for a
property that has been denied, in whole or in part, or approved to a
zoning district other than the one originally requested, shall not be
resubmitted within two years of the date of the City Council's action on
the original petition, except as permitted in item b below. This section
shall not apply to rezoning petitions initiated by someone other than
the property owner or authorized agent.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The City Council may, by a majority vote, allow
resubmission of a zoning map amendment petition within the two-year time
frame if it determines that, since the date of action on the prior
petition, one or more of the following guidelines have been met:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> There has been a similar or more intensive change
in the zoning district designation of an adjacent property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The City Council has adopted a public policy
plan, an updated Comprehensive Plan, an area plan, or a transportation
plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by
the amendment should be developed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Construction or expansion of a road, water
line, sewer line, or other infrastructure has occurred to serve the
property and which infrastructure can accommodate the intensity of
development allowed under the proposed classification.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> There has been some other substantial change in
conditions or circumstances which justifies waiver of the two-year
restriction on a new petition. This shall not include a change in the
ownership of the subject property or, in the case of a petition for a
zoning map amendment to a conditional zoning district, a change in the
scale or features of the development proposed in the prior petition.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Prior to voting on the resubmission, the City
Council shall receive a report from the Planning Department containing
its recommendations on resubmission of the petition.</p>
<p><strong>S. Changes to an Approved Conditional and Exception (EX)
District Rezoning Petitions</strong></p>
<p>Changes to approved conditional and exception (EX) plans and
conditions of development will require a new application for a zoning
map amendment, with a new public hearing, unless an approved
administrative amendment, administrative minor adjustment, alternative
compliance approval, or variance is approved to allow the change.</p>
<p><strong>T.</strong> <strong>Expiration of Zoning Map Amendment
Petition</strong></p>
<p>If a decision on a proposed zoning map amendment has not been reached
within two years from the date the zoning map amendment petition is
submitted and deemed complete, then the petition shall become null and
void.</p>
<h2>37.3</h2>
<p><strong>A. Purpose and Applicability</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> An administrative minor amendment is defined as
an amendment to a conditional zoning district, which includes an
exception (EX) district, that does not significantly alter a conditional
or exception (EX) site plan or its conditions and the change does not
have a significant impact upon adjacent properties.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> All other modifications to the conditions of an
approved conditional or exception (EX) district require a new zoning map
amendment petition.</p>
<p><strong>B. Administrative Minor Amendment Process</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Application</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Any petition for an administrative minor
amendment shall include the details of the requested change and shall be
on a form prescribed by the Planning Department, signed by the property
owner(s), and submitted to the Planning Director. Accompanying the
petition shall be the applicable fee for administrative review. Upon
request, the petitioner shall provide any additional information that is
requested.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> If multiple parcels of land are subject to an
approved conditional or exception (EX) district, the owners of
individual parcels may apply for an administrative minor amendment to
modify the conditions on their parcels so long as the modification would
not result in other properties failing to meet the approved site plan,
and/or site-specific conditions, and standards of the zoning district
and other regulations in the UDO or remove entitlements from other
individual parcels without the owner’s consent. Any modifications
approved through an administrative minor amendment shall apply only to
those properties whose owners apply for the administrative minor
amendment.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Any changes that increase the density (number of
dwelling units per acre) of the development or change allowed uses are
considered to be significant changes that cannot be considered through
an administrative minor amendment and shall go through the zoning map
approval process to amend the conditional or exception (EX) site plan
and/or site-specific conditions. Other significant changes to an
approved site plan and/or site-specific conditional plan that cannot be
considered an administrative minor amendment include the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Increasing the number of buildings.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Adding driveway connections to arterials or
limited access roads.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Reducing vehicular or bicycle parking spaces
below the minimum number or above the maximum number in conditional and
exception (EX) plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Reducing landscape yards and setbacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Moving structures closer to abutting properties
in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type or Neighborhood 2 Place Type or closer to
a single family, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex dwelling.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> Reducing open space.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vii.</strong> Changing owner occupied units to rental if
noted on the site plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>viii.</strong> Increasing the mass of buildings.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Staff Authority and Decision</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The Planning Director shall have the authority to
approve or deny an administrative minor amendment to an approved
conditional or exception (EX) plan or conditions. The standard for
approving or denying such a requested change shall be that the change
does not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions and the
change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The Planning Director shall also have the
discretion to decline to exercise the authority due to uncertainty about
approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning
petition for a public hearing and City Council consideration is deemed
appropriate under the circumstances. If the Planning Director declines
to exercise this authority, then the applicant can only file a rezoning
petition for a new public hearing and Council decision.</p>
<p><strong>3. Notification of Decision</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Planning Director making the decision on a request for an
administrative minor amendment shall give written notice to the property
owner and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the
property owner. The notice may be issued in print or electronic form.
Any decision issued exclusively in electronic form shall be protected
from further editing once issued. The written notice of the decision
shall be delivered by personal delivery, email, or first-class mail. If
the notice is sent by first-class mail, the notice shall be sent to the
last address listed for the property owner or the affected property on
the Mecklenburg County tax abstract, and to the address provided in the
application if the owner is not the petitioner.</p>
<p><strong>4. Appeals of Administrative Minor Amendment
Decisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The property owner or petitioner shall have 30
days from receipt of the written notice of decision within which to file
an appeal with the clerk to the UDO Board of Adjustment. Any other
person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt from any source
of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an
appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given by
first-class mail is deemed received on the third business day following
deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal
Service.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The UDO Board of Adjustment shall hold an
evidentiary hearing to hear the appeal. The UDO Board of Adjustment may
affirm, reverse, or modify the decision under appeal, making findings of
fact and conclusions of law to support its decision.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Appeals of the UDO Board of Adjustment decision
may be made to Mecklenburg County Superior Court.</p>

alternative conditions for approval of qualitative standards are
provided in the section where the qualitative standard is
established:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The physical contours of the street, the land, or

<h2>37.6 VESTED RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Pursuant to N.C.G.S. Chapter 160D-102, “Definitions, Chapter
160D-108, “Vested Rights and Permit Choice”, and Chapter 160D-108.1,
“Vested-Rights – Site Specific Vesting Plans, “there are 5 types of
vested rights outlined in this section, with different vested right time
periods and provisions: site-specific vesting plans, multi-phased
development plans, preliminary subdivision plans, development permit
vesting, and common-law vesting.</p>
<p><strong>A. Applicability</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The establishment of a vested right in this
section does not preclude vesting under one or more of the other types
of vesting outlined in this section.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> A vested right, once established, precludes any
action by the City that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish,
or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the
applicable land development regulations(s), except where a change in
State or federal law mandating City and County enforcement occurs after
the development application is submitted that has a fundamental and
retroactive effect on the development or use.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Vested rights run with the land, except for the
use of land for outdoor advertising governed by N.C.G.S. Chapter
136-131.1 and 136-131.2 in which case the vested rights granted run with
the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of
Transportation.</p>
<p><strong>B. Site-Specific Vesting Plans</strong></p>
<p>A site-specific vesting plan is a development plan in which the
applicant receives vesting approved by City Council. A site-specific
plan provides a description of the type and intensity of use for a
specific parcel(s) of property. The approval of such plans gives the
owner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of
said property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific
development plan, in accordance with N.C.G.S. Chapter 160D-108.1(a),
(b), and (c), including any amendments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Site-Specific Development
Plans</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Conditional district (CD) and exception (EX) zoning map amendments
are identified as site-specific vesting plans in this Ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>2. Approval</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a</strong>. A site-specific vesting plan associated with a
conditional (CD) or exception EX zoning map amendment is approved by
City Council, after notice and a legislative public hearing in

approval.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Duration</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Conditional and exception (EX) zoning map amendments are vested for a
period of two years. An extended five-year vesting may be requested by a
petitioner and approved by City Council through a zoning map amendment,
for development where such extended period is warranted in light of all
relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the size and
phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the
development, economic cycles, and market conditions, or other
considerations.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Termination</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A site-specific vested right terminates at the end of the applicable
vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid
building permit applications have been filed.</p>
<p><strong>C. Multi-Phased Development Vesting Plans</strong></p>
<p>A multi-phase development is a development containing at least 25
acres or more, planned to be developed in more than one phase, and
subject to a master plan. A multi-phased development plan provides a
description of committed elements including the type and intensity of
uses for each phase.</p>
<p><strong>1. Approval</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A multi-phased development plan including committed elements showing
the type and intensity of use for each phase associated with a

accordance with Section 37.2, “Zoning Map Amendments.”</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Duration</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The entire multi-phase development is vested at the time of the site
plan approval of a conditional (CD) or exception (EX) zoning map
amendment. The vesting is valid for seven years and is for the
development regulations in place at the time of the approval.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Termination</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A vested right for a multi-phased development plan expires at the end
of the applicable vesting period.</p>
<p><strong>D. Other Provisions for Site-Specific and Multi-Phased
Development Vesting Plans</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If a variance or alternative compliance approval
is required for a site-specific plan, it shall be obtained prior to the
approval of a site-specific vesting plan, per N.C.G.S.
160D-108.1(a).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Approval of site-specific vesting does not
preclude the application of overlay zoning regulations which impose
additional requirements, but do not affect the allowable type or
intensity of use, or regulations which are general in nature and are
applicable to all property subject to development regulation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> New zoning regulations that occur after the
approval of site-specific and multi-phased development vesting plans do
not override the specific conditions and zoning regulations in effect at
the time of approval of the conditional (CD) or exception (EX)
site-specific or multi-phased development plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Following approval of a site-specific or
multi-phased development vesting plan, the City and/or County may make
subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance
with the terms and conditions of the original approval.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> An approved site-specific or multi-phased
development vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the
approval of the owner and the City through a zoning map amendment in
accordance with Section 37.2, or through an administrative minor
amendment in accordance with Section 37.3.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong> The establishment of a site-specific or
multi-phased development vested right does not preclude, change, or
impair the authority of the City to adopt and enforce development
regulations governing nonconforming situations or uses.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7.</strong> The City may revoke the original site-specific or
multi-phased development plan approval for failure to comply with
applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the
applicable local development regulations in accordance with N.C.G.S.
Chapter 160D-403(f).</p>
<p><strong>E. Preliminary Subdivision Plan Vesting</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Approval</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A preliminary subdivision plan is approved by the Subdivision,
Streets, and Infrastructure Administrator in accordance with Section
30.6.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Duration</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A preliminary subdivision plan approval is vested for a period of
three years, allowing the developer to begin construction, including
installation of utilities associated with the plan approval. After the
installation has occurred, the plan remains valid until construction is
complete. If no construction is started within three years, the
preliminary subdivision plan is no longer valid and a new plan submittal
and approval are required.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> <strong>Development Permit Vesting
Provisions</strong></p>
<p>Development permits are administrative and quasi-judicial approvals
that are required prior to commencing development or undertaking a
specific activity, project, or development proposal, including, but not
limited to, zoning permits, sign permits, site plan approvals,
variances, alternative compliance approvals, certificates of
appropriateness, driveway permits, soil erosion and sedimentation
control permits, stormwater and land disturbance permits. The vesting

permit remains valid.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Duration</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Development permit approvals, with the exception of certificates of
appropriateness, are vested for a period of three years from the date an
application was approved, and expire at three years unless work
authorized by the permit is substantially commenced, or a development
regulation provides for a longer permit expiration period, or the
development regulation allows for time extension beyond the original
three years, or provides a renewal process. Certificates of
appropriateness are vested for one year.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Termination</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The vested right for a development shall expire for an uncompleted
development project if development work is intentionally and voluntarily
discontinued for a period of not less than three consecutive years.</p>
<p><strong>G. Common Law Vested Right</strong></p>
<p>A common law vested right establishes the right to undertake and
complete the development and use of property where substantial
expenditure of resources (which can include the expenditure of money,
time, and/or labor) were made in good faith and the expenditures were
made in reliance on a valid development permit or development approval.
A person claiming a common law vested right shall submit information to
substantiate that claim to the designated administrator that
demonstrates that substantial expenditures were made relying in good
faith on a valid development permit or development approval. The
designated administrator shall make a determination as to the existence
of the vested right, as provided in N.C.G.S. § 160D-108(h). Nothing in
this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law
principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in
a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as
expressly provided in §160D-108, nothing in this section shall be
construed to alter the existing common law.</p>

<p><strong>13. Standards for Granting a Variance</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Standards Applicable to Variances</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict
letter of zoning and development regulations, the UDO Board of
Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions upon a showing of all of the
following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict
application of the regulation. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate
that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of
the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The hardship results from conditions that are
peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.
Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships
resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the
general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance
may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable
accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a
disability.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The hardship did not result from actions taken
by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property
with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of
a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> The requested variance is consistent with the
spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety

to afford relief<strong>.</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> Variances may be issued for functionally
dependent facilities, if determined to meet the definition of Article
27, provided the provisions of Sections 27.3 and 27.4 have been
satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to
public safety.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> A floodplain variance to the requirement for
