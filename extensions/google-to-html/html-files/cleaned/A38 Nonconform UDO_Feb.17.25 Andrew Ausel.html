<p><strong>C. Burden on Property Owner</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-burden-of-establishing-a-nonconformity-under-the-provisions-of-this-ordinance-is-the-responsibility-of-the-property-owner-or-operator-of-the-nonconforming-structure-use-lot-site-element-or-sign.-based-upon-the-evidence-presented-the-zoning-administrator-will-make-a-determination-of-the-validity-of-the-nonconforming-status.">The
burden of establishing a nonconformity under the provisions of this
Ordinance is the responsibility of the property owner or operator of the
nonconforming structure, use, lot, site element, or sign. Based upon the
evidence presented, the Zoning Administrator will make a determination
of the validity of the nonconforming status.</h2>
<h2>38.2 NONCONFORMING USES</h2>
<p>Nonconforming uses of land or structures, and nonconforming
structures that contain nonconforming uses may continue only in
accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to
allow the continuation of a nonconforming use.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> A nonconforming use located outside of a
structure shall not be expanded. A nonconforming use located within a
structure may be expanded within the structure or enlarged by additions
to the structure in which the nonconforming use is located under the
following conditions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The expansion of the nonconforming use shall not
exceed 25% of the gross floor area of the existing structure, or 1,000
square feet, whichever is less, and</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Only one expansion of a nonconforming use located
within a structure shall be permitted.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> A structure in which a nonconforming use is
located and will be maintained shall not be moved unless the use
thereafter shall conform to the standards of the zoning district(s) to
which it is moved.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> A nonconforming use of a structure or land may be
changed to another nonconforming use within the same use category of the
Use Matrix in Article 15 if the change to another nonconforming use does
not generate any secondary effects such as more automobile or truck
traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, dust, or fumes than the original
nonconforming use as determined by the Zoning Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Once a nonconforming use is changed to a
conforming use, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Where a nonconforming use is visibly discontinued
for 12 consecutive months, the use shall not be re-established or
resumed, and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform
to the requirements of this Ordinance</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Where a structure in which a nonconforming use is
located is destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, or other act(s) of
God, the structure may be repaired or restored to its original
dimensions and conditions and the nonconforming use re-established as
long as a building permit application for the repair or restoration is
submitted within 18 months of the date of the damage.</p>
<h2>38.3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES</h2>
<p>A nonconforming structure may continue in accordance with the
provisions of this section.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to
allow the continuation of nonconforming structures.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Except as provided in items C and D below, a
nonconforming structure shall not undergo a change of use, renovation,
or expansion.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Unless otherwise stated elsewhere in the
Ordinance, a nonconforming structure may undergo a change of use or
renovation without having to bring the structure into conformity with
the requirements of this Ordinance, provided that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The change of use is to a use allowed within the
zoning district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The number of parking spaces provided for the use
is in conformity with the requirements of this Ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> A nonconforming structure may be expanded,
without bringing the remainder of the nonconforming structure into
conformity, only if the expansion and the area of the lot into which the
expansion is taking place are both in conformance with the requirements
of this Ordinance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Further, additions to legally nonconforming
structures in the following zoning districts are subject to the
following standards: Neighborhood Center Zoning District, Regional
Activity Center Zoning Districts, Innovation Mixed-Use Zoning District,
Transit Oriented Development Zoning Districts, and the IC-2, RC, and
CAC-2 Zoning Districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> When an addition does not exceed 25% of the gross
floor area of the structure or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less, the
addition shall meet only the following standards:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Building siting standards:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Required setback line by frontage type.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> Build-to zone. The Zoning Administrator may
waive this requirement, if it is determined the build-to zone is not
practical.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> Minimum build-to percentage. The Zoning
Administrator may waive this requirement, if it is determined the
minimum build-to percentage is not practical.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> Side and rear setbacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Maximum building height.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> When an addition equals or exceeds 25% of the
gross floor area of the structure or 1,000 square feet, whichever is
less, the addition shall comply with zoning district standards, with the
exception of requirements for vertical distance between building entry
and sidewalk.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> If additions to the structure are incremental,
the sum total of all expansions that occur after the effective date of
this Ordinance shall be recorded to ensure the limitation of item 1
above is not exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Alterations to nonconforming structures shall not
increase in the degree of nonconformity of any feature that previously
rendered them nonconforming.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> A nonconforming structure shall not be moved
unless it thereafter conforms to the standards of the zoning district in
which it is located.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Where a nonconforming structure is destroyed or
damaged by fire, flood, wind, or other act(s) of God, the structure may
be repaired or restored to its original dimensions and conditions as
long as a building permit application for the repair or restoration is
issued within 18 months of the date of the damage.</p>
<p><strong>H.</strong> An existing manufactured home located in a
nonconforming manufactured home park may be replaced with another
manufactured home provided the number of manufactured home units may not
be increased beyond the number available before replacement and the
replacing manufactured home shall not create nonconforming setbacks,
separation distances, or increase existing nonconforming setbacks or
separation distances.</p>
<h2>38.4 NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No nonconforming accessory use or accessory
structure shall continue after the principal use or structure is
discontinued, damaged, or destroyed unless such accessory use or
accessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards of
the zoning district in which it is located.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> An existing, nonconforming aboveground utility
accessory structure or mechanical equipment may be replaced provided the
replacement structure does not increase any existing nonconformity
caused by an extension into a required side or rear setback. The
replacement nonconforming aboveground utility accessory structure or
mechanical equipment shall not exceed 42 inches in height if located in
an established setback along a frontage.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> A nonconforming accessory use or accessory
structure may be expanded only if the nonconforming features of that use
or structure are not expanded so as to increase the degree of
nonconformity.</p>
<h2>38.5 NONCONFORMING EXTERIOR LIGHTING</h2>
<p>The Zoning Administrator may permit alterations to existing
nonconforming lighting that brings such lighting into greater
conformance but not entirely into conformance. (<em>For example, if the
fixture is replaced so that the lighting meets cut-off standards but
remains nonconforming in terms of height, such action may be permitted
by the Zoning Administrator.</em>)</p>
<h2>38.6 NONCONFORMING SIGNS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Nonconforming On-Premise Signs</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding 39.2.E.4.b, nonconforming on-premise signs shall be
subject to all applicable nonconforming provisions of this Ordinance and
may remain until one of the following occurs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The sign(s) is moved, removed, or replaced by
voluntary action. Any such sign, or portion thereof, which is required
to be relocated due to a governmental action, such as a roadway
improvement, may be moved to another location on the same property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Any change to the sign that is not one of the
following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Necessitated by routine maintenance or
repairs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Necessitated for compliance with minimum building
or electrical codes.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> A change to the existing sign face not involving
the modification of the size or shape of the sign face.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Approval of a sign permit application to add new
or additional signage to the site of a nonconforming sign.</p>
<p><strong>B. Nonconforming Outdoor Advertising Signs</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Existing outdoor advertising signs that do not
meet the standards of Table 22-4 or Table 22-5 but conform to the
standards of Table 22-6 may continue and are deemed nonconforming.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Existing outdoor advertising signs that do not
meet the standards of Table 22-4, Table 22-5, or Table 22-6, but can be
rebuilt or replaced to conform to the standards of Table 22-6, may be
rebuilt or replaced so long as the sign height and sign area are not
increased. A sign permit shall be obtained to rebuild or replace such
sign and the sign permit obtained shall be valid and unexpired prior to
the removal of the existing sign.</p>

<h2>38.7 NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Definition</strong></p>
<p>A nonconforming site element is a physical characteristic of a site
such as landscape, fences or walls, and parking and loading. This does
not include nonconforming accessory uses and accessory structures,
exterior lighting, and signs which are regulated by Sections 38.4, 38.5,
and 38.6 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>B. Applicability</strong></p>
<p>A nonconforming site element may continue in accordance with the
provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="heading" id="c.-maintenance"><strong>C.
Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a nonconforming site
element may be performed. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted
that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the
previously existing nonconformity. Resealing, restriping, or resurfacing
of an existing parking lot is considered normal maintenance and
incidental repair, and not reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>D. Required Conformance</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated elsewhere in the Ordinance, all nonconforming
site elements must be brought into conformance when there is
construction of a new principal building.</p>
<h2>38.8 NONCONFORMING LOTS</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Except as provided in item B below, a
nonconforming lot may be used for any of the uses permitted in the
zoning district in which it is located, provided that the development on
the lot meets all dimensional and design standards of that zoning
district.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> A vacant nonconforming lot shall not be used if
it could be combined with another vacant adjoining lot(s) owned by the
same person, or entity, in order to create one or more conforming lots.
When a single property owner owns only two existing adjoining
nonconforming lots, and the combination would result in the creation of
a single lot that is more than 1.5 times the width and area required in
the zoning district, the single lot may be divided into two lots of
equal width and area without being further classified as
nonconforming.</p>
