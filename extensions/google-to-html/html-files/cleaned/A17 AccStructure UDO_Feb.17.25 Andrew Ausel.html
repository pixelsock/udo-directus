<h2>17.1 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES</h2>
<p>All accessory structures are subject to the following regulations,
unless otherwise permitted or restricted by specific regulations of this
article and this Ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Accessory structures are permitted in all zoning
districts, unless otherwise restricted by this article.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> On individual lots with a detached single-family,
duplex, triplex, or quadraplex principal structure any accessory
structure(s) shall be located on the same lot as the principal
structure.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> No accessory structure shall be constructed
before the principal structure or use receives building permit or zoning
use approval. A constructed accessory structure shall not be deemed to
give authorization to a principal use not permitted in the zoning
district. Construction of an accessory structure may be approved in
conjunction with approval of construction of the principal use. Such
accessory structure shall not be occupied or used until all permits for
the principal structure are passed and closed, and a certificate of
compliance or occupancy is obtained. Private docks and piers may be
allowed prior to the principal structure in Neighborhood 1 Zoning
Districts.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> A zoning use permit is required for all permanent
accessory structures, except for those permanent structures that require
a building permit. In addition, certain accessory structures that do not
qualify as permanent also require a zoning use permit per this article
unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Accessory structures are subject to the following
locational requirements:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> No accessory structure is permitted in the
established front or corner side setback along a street or frontage
except as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Mailboxes, utility poles, light poles, and other
similar accessory structures are allowed within an established front or
corner side setback along a street or frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Specific accessory structures may only be allowed
in an established front or corner side setback along a street or
frontage by specific provisions of this Ordinance. When permitted in an
established front or corner side setback, an accessory structure shall
not locate in the required setback along a street or frontage unless it
is also specifically allowed by this Ordinance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Accessory structures may be located in an
established front setback along a street for a single-family detached
dwelling if such dwelling is set back from the right-of-way a minimum of
150 feet and provided the accessory structure is set back a minimum of
50 feet from the right-of-way and is subject to the required side
setback for the zoning district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> In the case of a through lot, one of the front
setbacks, or setbacks along a frontage as applicable, shall be
considered a rear setback for the purposes of the accessory structure
regulations of this article only, and no accessory structure shall be
allowed within this dimension.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> Paved on-grade surfaces such as driveways,
patios, sidewalks, and surface parking areas may encroach into required
setbacks unless limited elsewhere in this Ordinance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Accessory structures in an established side or
rear setback shall be located a minimum of three feet from a lot line
except as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Accessory structures with a height of 24 feet or
more, or under 24 feet but with a height taller than the principal
structure, shall be setback from any rear lot line a minimum of 15 feet
and from any side lot line by the dimension of the required side setback
for the zoning district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> If a specific accessory structure’s location in
the established side or rear setback is further restricted by the
provisions of this Ordinance, the more stringent standard shall
apply.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> All accessory structures shall be located on the
same site as the principal structure they support. Except as otherwise
permitted by these regulations, no accessory structure shall be
permitted which obstructs or otherwise interferes with use of a public
street, network-required private street, or pedestrian facilities.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> A detached accessory structure connected to a
principal structure by a breezeway (see Article 18) is considered
detached and subject to all applicable dimensional and locational
requirements for detached accessory structures.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> For lots in residential use, the cumulative
square footage of all accessory structures, excluding accessory dwelling
units (ADUs), on a lot shall not exceed the total square footage of the
heated area located on the first floor of the principal structure.
Accessory structures open to the sky such as, but not limited to, pools
and tennis courts, do not count towards this square footage
limitation.</p>
