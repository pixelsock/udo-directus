<h2>20.1 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The landscape and screening requirements established by this Article
are intended to:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Preserve and enhance the appearance and character
of the City.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Increase the compatibility of adjacent uses and
minimize the potential negative impacts to neighboring uses.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Create transitional areas between uses or zoning
districts of different intensities.</p>
<h2>20.2 SELECTION, INSTALLATION, AND MAINTENANCE</h2>
<p>The following standards apply to the landscape areas per Section 20.5
through 20.12 of this Article.</p>
<p><strong>A. Selection</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Only shrubs and trees listed on the Approved
Plant Species list in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual
(CLDSM) shall be used for any landscaping required by this Article.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> All plants shall meet minimum quality
requirements and be free of defects, and of normal health, height, leaf
density, and spread as defined by the American Standard for Nursery
Stock, ANSI Z60.1, latest available edition, American Horticulture
Industry Association (AmericanHort).</p>
<p><strong>B. Installation</strong></p>
<p>All landscaping shall be installed according to sound horticultural
practices in a manner designed to encourage quick establishment and
healthy growth, and consistent with the CLDSM.</p>
<p><strong>C. Species Diversity</strong></p>
<p>Diversity among required plant material is required for visual
interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of plants
due to disease.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The species diversity requirements of this
section apply as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Species diversity applies to landscape plantings
required by Section 20.2 through 20.12 of this Article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Species diversity only applies to the
installation of new plantings.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Table 20-1: Plant Diversity Requirements
indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total
quantity of species being used. (<em>For example, if a development
requires 45 shade trees, no more than 18 trees (40%) can be of any one
species, and there shall be a minimum of five different species within
the 45 trees.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>D. Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Trees and vegetation, irrigation systems, fences,
walls, and other similar items are considered landscape elements of a
development.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> All landscaping shall be free from disease,
pests, weeds, and litter. All landscape elements shall be maintained in
good repair or replaced periodically as needed to ensure their continued
function, structural soundness, and aesthetically pleasing
condition.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Any landscape element that dies or is seriously
damaged, shall be removed and replaced within 30 days of the beginning
of the subsequent growing season.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Any ornamental grasses or shrubs planted next to
sidewalks shall be planted and maintained so that they do not encroach
into sidewalks at maturity.</p>
<p><strong>E. Existing Plantings</strong></p>
<p>Existing plantings within the required landscape areas, such as the
landscape yard, may be counted toward planting requirements of this
Article, with the exception of trees planted pursuant to green area
requirements per Section 20.15, frontage tree planting requirements per
Section 20.16, and tree planting requirements per Section 20.17, with
the approval of the Zoning Administrator in consultation with the Chief
Urban Forester.</p>
<p><strong>F. Additional Trees and Shrubs</strong></p>
<p>Additional trees and shrubs may be installed in required landscape
areas in excess of the requirements of this Article.</p>
<h2>20.3 LANDSCAPE PLANTINGS</h2>
<p>The following are the planting sizes required for each landscape area
per Section 20.5 through 20.12 of this Article. All trees shall be
allowed to grow to natural form and height.</p>
<p><strong>A. Plantings Sizes for Parking Lot Screening</strong></p>
<p>Shrubs shall be evergreen and shall be at least two feet in height

<h2>20.4 ALTERNATIVE LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The Zoning Administrator may alter the screening,
landscape area, or landscape yards requirements of Section 20.1 through
20.12 of this Article per the Administrative Adjustment Standards in
Section 37.4 in the event that one or more of the following conditions
would make strict adherence to the requirements serve no meaningful
purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain
the required landscape yard or screening:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The unusual topography or elevation of a
development site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The soil or other sub-surface conditions on the
site.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The Zoning Administrator shall not alter the
screening, landscape area, or landscape yard requirements of Section
20.1 through 20.12 of this Article unless the developer demonstrates
that the modified landscape yard or screening will comply with the
spirit and intent of this Article and that the existing site features
and any additional landscape yard materials will screen the proposed use
as effectively as the required landscape yard or screening.</p>
<h2>20.5 REQUIRED SCREENING FOR PARKING LOTS</h2>
<p><strong>A. General Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Screening for parking lots and associated maneuvering areas is
required for parking lots of ten or more vehicle spaces at the edge of
the parking lot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The following exceptions apply:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> When parking areas are shared between properties,
parking lot screening is not required along any shared lot line and/or
cross-access connection area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> When parking lot screening is required between
abutting properties and a landscape yard per Section 20.9 is also
required, the requirements of the landscape yard control.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Vehicle dealerships are not required to install
parking lot screening in those areas of the parking lot used to display
vehicles for sale along a street frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Parking lot screening is not required if the
Zoning Administrator determines that adherence to this requirement would
serve no meaningful purpose including, but not limited to, the grade on
the site and the distance of the parking lot to adjacent properties.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Parking lot screening shall be installed
when:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A new principal building is constructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> A new parking lot of ten or more spaces is
constructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Spaces are added to an existing parking lot where
the total of existing and new spaces is ten or more spaces.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> At least 50% of the parking lot area is
reconstructed. Resealing, restriping, or resurfacing of an existing
parking lot is considered normal maintenance and incidental repair, and
not reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>B. Design of Screening Areas</strong></p>
<p>The screening area shall be improved as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The screening area shall be at least five feet in
width.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> There shall be an additional minimum linear
distance of two feet between the screening area and any wheel stops or
bollards to accommodate vehicle bumper overhang. This is not included in
the minimum five foot calculation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> The parking lot screening area shall be
landscaped and designed as one or more of the following installations.
Any required tree planting shall comply with the tree planting
requirements of Sections 20.16 and 20.17 below, where applicable.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> One shrub shall be planted for every five linear
feet of screening area length. However, shrubs shall not be planted
within four feet of a tree.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> As an alternate to the shrub plantings in item a
above, for screening along a frontage a low pedestrian wall a minimum of
three feet and a maximum of four feet in height constructed of masonry,
concrete, or similar permanent material may be installed. In this
alternative, the parking lot screening area may be reduced to three feet
in width. The requirements of item 2 above shall also apply to this
alternative.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Shrubs, groundcover, perennials, ornamental
grasses, and other planting types of species native or naturalized
non-invasive to North Carolina shall be planted in front of such wall,
facing toward frontages or adjacent properties, covering a minimum of
40% of the total screening area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Up to 30% of the total length of such wall may
be designed as a seating wall. Where seating areas are included, the
minimum wall height does not apply and plantings are not required in
front of the seating wall. Seating areas shall be oriented towards the
frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> The following may cover any remaining unplanted
area:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Shrubs, groundcover, perennials, ornamental
grasses, and other planting types of species native or naturalized
non-invasive to North Carolina.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Stone, mulch, or other permeable landscape
materials.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> A fence or wall may be used for screening in
accordance with Section 17.2.D and as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The area for the fence or wall shall be wide
enough to accommodate the fence or wall and allow for its
maintenance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Any fences or walls used for screening shall be
constructed in a durable fashion of brick, finished masonry, stone, wood
posts and planks, metal, or other materials specifically designed as
fencing materials, or any combination thereof as may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The fence or wall shall be a minimum of 75%
opaque, and the finished side, as opposed to the side with the exposed
structural supports, of the fence or wall shall face the abutting
property. A chain link fence with metal, plastic, or wooden slats shall
not be used to meet any screening required by this Ordinance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> The minimum height of the fence or wall shall be
four feet or whatever is sufficient to visually separate the uses.</p>

LOT SCREENING</strong></p>
<h2>20.6 PARKING LOT INTERIOR LANDSCAPE</h2>
<p>Interior parking lot landscaping is governed by Section 20.17
below.</p>
<h2>20.7 PARKING FACILITY DRIVEWAY AND MANEUVERING AREA
LANDSCAPE</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The parking lot screening requirements of Section
20.5 shall apply to all driveway and maneuvering areas that are not
adjacent to parking spaces for parking lots of ten or more spaces and
for all driveway and maneuvering areas of parking structures.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> When such driveway and maneuvering areas
described in item A above are located within an established side or rear
setback along an adjacent property line, a fence or wall a minimum of
six feet to a maximum of eight feet may be used in place of the
screening area except within the established setback along a
frontage.</p>
<h2>20.8 PARKING STRUCTURE LANDSCAPE AREA</h2>
<p>As required in Section 19.7 for the design of parking structures,
when a landscape area is required, it shall be planted as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> One shrub shall be planted for every five linear
feet of perimeter area. Shrubs may be varied in placement, rather than
linearly spaced, but the total number of shrubs planted shall equal one
shrub per five linear feet. However, shrubs shall not be planted within
four feet of a tree.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> A minimum of one large or medium maturing tree
shall be provided for every 30 linear feet of the landscape area. Two
small maturing trees may be substituted for one large or medium maturing
tree. Trees may be spaced linearly on-center or grouped to complement an
overall design concept.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The remainder of the required landscape area
outside of shrub and tree masses shall be planted in groundcover, turf,
perennials, ornamental grasses, and other planting types of species
native or naturalized non-invasive to North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>PARKING STRUCTURE LANDSCAPE AREA</strong></p>

<h2>20.9 LANDSCAPE YARD</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Certain uses or zoning districts, because of
their character and/or intensity, may create adverse impacts when
developed abutting other less intensive uses or zoning districts. A
landscape yard provides a transition between these uses and/or zoning
districts that minimizes adverse impacts.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> When a landscape yard is required by this
section, and a site does not have a landscape yard or the existing
landscape yard on the site does not meet the standards of this section,
a landscape yard shall be installed when any of the following actions
occur:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Construction of a new principal or accessory
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> An addition to an existing principal
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Establishment of a new principal or accessory use
conducted primarily outdoors.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> A change of use category within the Use Matrix
found in Article 15, or an additional principal or accessory use is
established on the site, when abutting a Neighborhood 1 Place Type.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Expansion of a parking lot by the addition of 10
or more parking spaces.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> A landscape yard shall not be required along the
shared property line of abutting lots developed with a nonresidential
use or mixed-use, and located in a Neighborhood 1 or Neighborhood 2
Place Type.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Upon an applicant’s request, if the Zoning
Administrator determines that the requirement for a landscape yard is
unrelated to the proposed construction’s anticipated impacts on adjacent
properties, the Zoning Administrator may modify the landscape yard
requirement, per the Administrative Adjustment Standards in Section
37.4, to the extent necessary to relate to the proposed construction’s
anticipated impacts and to make the requirement roughly proportional to
those anticipated impacts. The Zoning Administrator may reduce the
landscape yard requirement up to 50% of the required landscape yard
width but to a remaining width of no less than 10’.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> The Zoning Administrator may modify or eliminate
the fence or wall requirements of Table 20-2 (below) upon an applicant’s
request in the event that one or more of the following would make strict
adherence to the requirement serve no meaningful purpose or would make
it physically impossible to install and maintain the required fence or
wall:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The topography or elevation of the development
site in relation to the abutting site to be screened.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Creek crossings or creek buffers that do not
allow a fence or wall.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Utility crossings that do not allow a fence or
wall.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> A tree save area that is both a minimum of 50
feet in width and 100 feet in length that meets the intent of the fence
or wall. This shall only apply for the portion of the fence where the
tree save area runs along the location(s) where a fence or wall is
required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> An existing fence or wall located in the required
landscape yard meets the height and material requirements per this
ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> When a landscape yard is required by item B above
and there is insufficient area on the site for the required landscape
yard, such landscape yard may be modified to install only a portion of
the required landscape. The applicant is required to show that the
landscape yard cannot be accommodated on the site. The Zoning
Administrator will make the determination that a portion of required
landscape yard does not have to be installed.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Table 20-2: Landscape Yard Class describes the
width and design of each class of landscape yard. Table 20-3: Required
Landscape Yards by Zoning District indicates when and which class of
landscape yard is required. Where a use has prescribed conditions that
require a specific class of landscape yard, those conditions control
over the requirements of Table 20-3.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> For the Class A landscape yard, the landscape
yard is divided into Zone 1 and Zone 2 as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Zone 1 comprises the first 25 feet of the
landscape yard, measured perpendicularly from the rear or side lot
line.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Zone 2 comprises the remainder of the required
landscape yard outside of Zone 1. Within Zone 2, plantings may be
grouped to complement an overall design concept. The remainder of the
required landscape area in Zone 2 outside of required shrub and tree
masses shall be planted in turf, groundcover, perennials, ornamental
grasses, and other planting types of species native or naturalized
non-invasive species to North Carolina.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence" src="media/image3.jpg" style="width:6.46528in;height:2.00903in"/><strong>CLASS
A LANDSCAPE YARD: ZONE 1/ZONE 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>H.</strong> Landscape yards as required by Table 20-3 shall
be located within the established rear setback and within the
established side setback but behind the required front setback. The
following also apply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> In certain circumstances in Table 20-3, landscape
yards may be specifically required for other setback areas outside the
side or rear setback.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> For a nonresidential use that requires a
landscape yard in a side setback because it abuts an existing
residential use, and where the front building line of the residential
use is located closer to the back of curb, the side setback landscape
yard shall be extended to meet the front building line of the
residential structure.</p>

YARD WITH SIDE SETBACK EXTENSION</strong></p>
<p><strong>I.</strong> Landscape yards may be located within established
setbacks and shall be reserved for the planting of material and
installation of screening as required by this section unless other
features are allowed by item I below. No parking, principal or accessory
structures, outdoor storage, or required on-site open space, shall be
located in the landscape yard area.</p>
<p><strong>J.</strong> When a fence or wall is installed, it shall be a
minimum of 75% opaque, constructed of wood posts and planks, vinyl,
brick, finished masonry, or stone, and erected within 18 inches of the
lot line along 100% of the landscape yard length with the exception of
ingress/egress points. The finished side of the fence, as opposed to the
side with exposed structural supports, shall face the abutting
property.</p>
<p><strong>K.</strong> The following shall also be permitted within a
landscape yard:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Sidewalks and paths no greater than six feet in
width designed perpendicular (90 degrees) or to an angle no less than 75
degrees to the landscape yard. A required off-street trail connection
shall be permitted to exceed this six-foot dimension but shall be no
wider than the rest of the trail on the site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Within Zone 2 of the Class A landscape yard,
limited amenities, not associated with any required on-site open space
on the site, such as seating areas, walking paths, and picnic tables for
the use of the on-site users.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Utility lines per item J below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Stormwater facilities per item K below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Cross-access connections between adjacent
parcels.</p>
<p><strong>L.</strong> Utility lines, including stormwater and
water/sewer, within a landscape yard shall meet the following
requirements:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Utility easements are permitted to cross a
landscape yard perpendicularly (90 degrees) or to an angle a no less
than 75 degrees to the landscape yard. <strong><br/>
<br/>
2.</strong> The removal of any tree larger than eight inches in diameter
to accommodate utility lines shall require the approval of the Zoning
Administrator in consultation with the Chief Urban Forester.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> If utility easements run at an angle between zero
and up to 75 degrees within a landscape yard, the width of the landscape
yard shall be increased by the width of the utility easement.</p>
<p><strong>M.</strong> Certain elements of a required stormwater
facility, designed in accordance with Part IX. Stormwater and other
regulations of this Ordinance, may encroach into a required landscape
yard for up to 25% of the required landscape yard width. These elements
include, but are not limited to, the embankment, inlets, pipes, rip rap,
and any stormwater related easement, or similar elements. Such
encroachments shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator, in
consultation with the Stormwater Administrator. Stormwater related
easement, for the purposes of this article includes, but is not limited
to, storm drainage easements (SDE), public storm drainage easements
(PSDE), and conservation easements.</p>
<p><strong>N.</strong> Any requirement to install a landscape yard
abutting a park or greenway shall be waived in its entirety unless the
property is located within the Commercial Place Type or Manufacturing
and Logistics Place Type.</p>

<h2>20.13 TREE PROTECTION PURPOSE AND EXEMPTION</h2>

<p><strong>A.</strong>  The purpose of the tree protection provisions of
this Article are to preserve, protect and promote the health, safety,
and welfare of the public by providing for the regulation of the
planting, maintenance, and removal of trees located on property owned or
controlled by the City and on new developments and alterations to
previous developments on private property within the City and
extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).  </p>

<p><strong>B.</strong>  The intent of the tree protection standards of
this Article are to: </p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong>  Protect, facilitate, and enhance the aesthetic
qualities of the community to ensure that tree removal does not reduce
property values.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. </strong>Emphasize the importance of trees and vegetation
as both visual and physical buffers.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong>  Promote clean air quality by reducing air
pollution and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, returning pure
oxygen to the atmosphere, and increasing dust filtration.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Reduce the harmful effects of wind and air
turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Minimize increases in temperatures on lands with
tree cover.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong> Maintain moisture levels in the air of lands with
tree cover.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7.</strong> Emphasize the importance of safeguarding native
ecosystems through native tree preservation. </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8. </strong>Preserve underground water reservoirs and
facilitate the return of precipitation to the groundwater strata.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9. </strong>Prevent soil erosion.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10.</strong> Provide shade and mitigate heat island
effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>11.</strong> Minimize the cost of construction and
maintenance of drainage systems necessitated by the increased flow and
diversion of surface waters by facilitating a natural drainage system
and amelioration of stormwater drainage problems.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>12.</strong> Conserve natural resources, including adequate
air and water.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>13.</strong> Maintain and enhance the tree canopy cover
across the City. </p>
<p><strong>C. Exemption for Forestry Operations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">An activity undertaken on forestland for the production and
harvesting of timber and timber products and conducted in accordance
with standards defined by the Forest Practice Guidelines Related to
Water Quality (Best Management Practices), as adopted by the North
Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall be exempt
from Sections 20.13 through 20.18 of this Article. If the activity
undertaken on forestland for the production and harvesting of timber and
timber products is not conducted in accordance with standards defined by
the Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water Quality, the provisions
of this Article shall apply to such activity and any related activity on
the site.</p>

<h2>20.14 HERITAGE TREES</h2>
<p><strong>A. Applicability</strong></p>
<p>The requirements of this section shall apply to development activity,
including grading in anticipation of such development, within the
corporate limits of the City and the City's extraterritorial
jurisdiction (ETJ), whenever development would result in any of the
following:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> New construction of a principal structure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Cumulative increase in built-upon area (BUA) or
building coverage equal to or greater than 5% or 1,000 square feet,
whichever is less.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Approval of a subdivision as defined by Article
30.3.A.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Heritage trees shall be protected to the greatest
extent possible, as specified below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Heritage trees may be removed when a City-issued
tree work permit is requested and approved, or the standards listed
under item 2 below are met. No removal activities shall commence until
such permit is issued, any applicable mitigation payments have been
received, and a planting plan has been approved, unless removal is
permitted per item 2 below. Owners and persons who remove a heritage
tree or disturb the critical root zone of a heritage tree without a tree
work permit are subject to the civil penalties set forth in Section 4.1
of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual (Charlotte Tree Manual). The
critical root zone of a heritage tree shall only include the root area
located on the parcel or site where the trunk/main plant stem is rooted
in the ground. For purposes of this subsection, a development plan
approved by the City constitutes a tree work permit. Tree work permits
for the removal of heritage trees shall only be granted in the following
instances subject to specified mitigation requirements below:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong>  The tree and/or critical root zone are located
within an area where a structure or improvement may be placed and
imposes a documented and confirmed conflict. A documented and confirmed
conflict may include but not be limited to the location of structures,
site design elements, and required streets as allowed or required by
other articles of this Ordinance. Mitigation, per item 3 below, shall be
required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Preservation of the tree would unreasonably
restrict use of the property. An unreasonable restriction per this
section shall mean, significant restriction or negative impact to
public/private utility service, restriction of property access,
restriction of the ability to remedy significant damage to an existing
building or structure, or other restrictions of public infrastructure
that reasonable maintenance cannot prevent. Mitigation, per item 3
below, shall be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong>  The tree is sufficiently diseased, injured,
dead, in danger of falling, creates an imminent and undue hazard to life
and property that reasonable maintenance cannot mitigate, creates unsafe
sight distance, or conflicts with other sections of this Ordinance or
provisions of other ordinances or regulations. Mitigation shall not be
required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Heritage trees that are sufficiently diseased,
injured, dead, or are in danger of falling shall not be required to
obtain a City-issued tree work permit or mitigate the tree loss prior to
removal. Trees removed without a permit due to health or hazard shall be
either certified by an ISA-certified arborist or adequately documented
through picture, video or other documentation prior to removal. Heritage
trees that are in declining health may be removed without a City-issued
tree work permit only when certified by an ISA-Certified arborist prior
to removal. For the purpose of this section, a “tree in declining
health” shall mean a tree that can be expected to fall within a 1-3 year
time period per an assessment by an ISA-Certified arborist. </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Mitigation</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Owners and persons authorized by the City to remove a heritage tree,
per the conditions stated in this section shall comply with the
following mitigation actions:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Required Tree Replanting</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">One tree shall be planted on the property in mitigation pursuant to
Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual. Trees replanted to
meet this mitigation requirement shall be in addition to other trees
required by this article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Heritage Tree Mitigation Payment</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A heritage tree mitigation payment shall be required for every
heritage tree removed per the fee established by City Council. The
required mitigation payment may be reduced or eliminated where trees are
replanted on the property in addition to those required by item a above
and other tree replanting required by this Article. The rate of
reduction shall be subject to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Specimen Tree Preservation</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Specimen trees may be preserved to meet all Heritage Tree mitigation
requirements specified above. Only large hardwoods and large softwoods,
per the definition of this term in Article 2, shall be used to meet this
mitigation option. One specimen tree preserved shall meet the mitigation
requirements for the removal of one Heritage Tree approved for removal.
The critical root zone of specimen trees preserved shall be identified
and protected as a part of the required Tree Compliance Plan per Section
20.18 below, and pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Collected fees from mitigation per this item
shall be deposited into the account, or its equivalent, in the City’s
financial system as established in Section 20.18.D.1.c.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> No tree disturbing activity may impact any
heritage tree prior to approval and issuance of applicable tree work
permits by the City. Certain impacts to critical root zones shall be
permitted subject to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual
and the CLDSM.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> It shall be the duty of the property owner to
maintain, plant, and/or replace mitigation and heritages trees on
private property as required by this section. Trees shall be allowed to
grow to their natural height and form. Pruning of these trees may be
allowed where a tree work permit has been issued. Topping is prohibited.
Property owners will not be held liable for any pruning conducted by
utility providers.</p>
<h2>20.15 GREEN AREA</h2>
<p><strong>A. Applicability and Exemptions</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Applicability</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The green area requirements of this section shall apply to all
development activity, including grading in anticipation of such
development, within the corporate limits of the City and the City's
extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), whenever development would result
in any of the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> New construction of a principal structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Cumulative increase in built-upon area (BUA) or
building coverage equal to or greater than 5% or 1,000 square feet,
whichever is less.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Approval of a subdivision as defined by Article
30.3.A.</p>
<p><strong>2. Compliance</strong></p>
<p>The intent of green area compliance is for a site to reach full
compliance, even if an initial project(s) only requires proportional
compliance. Green area requirement compliance shall be achieved as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>a. Full Compliance</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Development activity that cumulatively impacts 75% or more of a site,
with cumulative impact considered for all development permitted on June
1, 2023 or later, shall fully comply with green area requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Proportional Compliance</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The following development activities qualify for proportional
compliance with green area requirements when a site retains an existing
principal building and when there is less than 75% cumulative
disturbance of the site area:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Construction of an additional principal
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Expansion of an existing principal
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Removal and replacement of an existing
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Expansion of existing built-upon area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Any combination of items i through iv above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sites qualifying for proportional compliance shall provide, at a
minimum, the same percentage of the required green area as the
percentage of the site being disturbed by the subject development
activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Tier 3 and Tier 4 sites, per Table 20-4 below, eligible for
proportional compliance per this section may also meet the green area
requirements of this section through Tier 1 Green Area Credit options
per Table 20-5 (below) upon a determination by the Chief Urban Forester
that compliance cannot otherwise feasibly be achieved via the Green Area
Credit options provided to the site by its assigned Tier. The
determination of the Chief Urban Forester shall be pursuant to the
provisions of Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual
(Charlotte Tree Manual).</p>
<p><strong>3. Exemptions</strong></p>
<p>The following are exempt from the requirements of this section as
specified below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Increases in built-upon area (BUA) or building
coverage on lots where the existing principal structure is a
single-family detached home, duplex, triplex or quadraplex.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Construction of a new single-family detached
home, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex as a principal structure on a
single lot, unless such construction is any of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Part of an approval of a new subdivision as defined by Section
30.3.A or Section 30.3.D,</p></li>
<li><p>Constructed on three or more contiguous/adjacent lots,
or</p></li>
<li><p>Part of a multi-dwelling development.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Public infrastructure projects such as road
expansion, public utility projects, and greenway trail construction,
undertaken by public entities unless such projects include increased
building coverage or parking lot expansion.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where public infrastructure projects are exempt from this section but
impact existing trees required or protected by Sections 20.14 through
20.17 or by legacy versions of the Charlotte Tree Ordinance, such
projects shall be subject to interdepartmental or interagency agreements
and land development standards pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual.</p>
<p><strong>B. Standards by Tier</strong></p>
<p>Green area, perimeter planting and internal planting requirements are
differentiated by Place Type as designated within the four tiers

<p><strong>C. Required Green Area</strong></p>
<p>15% or more of a development site that is subject to the
applicability of this section shall be green area to be credited as
provided for in Table 20-5 Green Area Credits.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Green Area Credits</strong></p>
<p>The standards and methods for calculating required green area for
sites shall be as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Green area credits shall be used to achieve the
required 15% green area pursuant to item B above. Green area credits are
based on the corresponding multipliers for each credit and found in
Table 20-5.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The process for calculating a property’s green
area credit shall be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The area of each green area credit is multiplied
by its corresponding multiplier.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The resulting green area credits are added
together.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The sum of these green area credits is then
divided by the total land area of the development site to determine the
green area percentage, which shall constitute at least 15% of the site
per item B above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> All Green Area Credits shall comply with
technical standards per Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration
Manual.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Square footage for existing and dedicated street
rights-of-way, railroad rights-of-way and utility easements and for
existing ponds and lakes shall be subtracted from the total site area
before the required percent of the green area is calculated.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Land clearing and inert debris (LCID) landfills
may also be subtracted from the total site area subject to the
following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The landfill has a current permit from the N.C.
Division of Waste Management, Solid Waste Division or has been
decommissioned and the planting of trees on the landfill area is not
recommended nor feasible.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The property on which the landfill is located is
not included in site calculations for any standards included in the
UDO.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The landfill area shall not be used to meet

<p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> The Chief Urban Forester may approve
preservation of non-contiguous fragments to meet the requirements of
this section per the Tree Canopy Manual (Section 4.1 of the Zoning
Administration Manual), where the preservation of these existing trees
would better meet the intent of this Ordinance.</p>
<p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In Tier 3 and Tier 4, as part of the
required green area, the removal of existing trees may only be approved
by the Chief Urban Forester pursuant to the Charlotte Tree Manual’s
Green Area Guideline when the tree and critical root zone are located
within the buildable area where a site improvement and/or City-required
structure will be placed and there is no other reasonable location,
and/or preservation would unreasonably restrict use of and/or access to
the property. The area of existing trees removed shall be replanted with
trees at 150% of the area removed at 36 trees per acre.</p>
<p><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> Only permitted for residential
development in N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, N1-D, and N1-E subject to the
applicability of this section.</p>
<p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Payment-in-Lieu and off-site mitigation
may not be used in combination to meet the requirements of this
section.</p>
<p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Intermittent and perennial streams
within the project boundary shall be delineated by a certified
professional using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and N.C. Division of
Water Quality methodology and shall be shown in the Tree Planting and
Green Area Plan along with all areas where this green area option is to
be used.</p>
<p><strong>E. Tree Save Standards</strong></p>
<p>The following standards shall apply to all tree save areas within the
required green area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1</strong>. Tree save areas shall be free of invasive plant
species unless otherwise approved by the Chief Urban Forester. If an
area proposed for tree save contains invasive plant species at the time
of such proposal, such invasive plant species shall be removed prior to
final plat approval for subdivisions. If there is no final plat for a
project, the invasive plant species shall be removed prior to the
issuance of the final certificate of occupancy. Invasive plant species
are considered removed if they are no longer living in or under the tree
canopy. Property owners are required to maintain this condition for
compliance with this section.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong>  Pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual, any alterations to the tree save area in Tier 3
and Tier 4 Place Types shall be accomplished without mechanized tools
and vehicular equipment and made of organic, environmentally friendly
materials, unless otherwise approved by the Chief Urban Forester. For
sites located in Tier 1 or Tier 2 Place Types, alterations to the tree
save area do not have to meet the above standard. However, if
alterations are made or amenities are added, these changes shall be made
in a manner that is not detrimental to the saved trees or their critical
root zone. Alterations and addition of any amenities shall be approved
by the Chief Urban Forester.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong>  Any tree save area less than 30 feet in width
shall be delineated on site with boundary and property lines by a
licensed surveyor prior to the first submittal of plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong>  No structure shall be allowed within ten feet of
the tree save area. A building restriction note shall be indicated on
the record plat pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration
Manual. For sites located in Tier 1 or Tier 2 Place Types, the ten foot
building restriction may be counted toward the tree save area
requirement as long as this area continuously and directly abuts a tree
save area and remains pervious. However, regulatory trees may not be
planted within this ten foot building restriction area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Additional amenity elements including, but not
limited to, benches, trails, gazebos, sheds, fences, may be permitted by
the Chief Urban Forester pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong>  Tree save areas may include areas dedicated to
Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation for greenways or parks or the
City of Charlotte for the Tree Canopy Preservation Program, Urban
Arboretum Trail, or other City trail projects. Dedicated tree save areas
may include passive use recreation areas and additional amenity elements
per Section 20.15.E.5 and per special agreement between the City and
Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation. Greenway placement, trail
placement, park design, and final location of all amenity elements shall
be coordinated with the Chief Urban Forester pursuant to Section 4.1 of
the UDO Zoning Administration Manual so that the effective tree save
area required is achieved and maintained.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7.</strong>  Tree save areas on sites in Tier 1, 2, and 3
Place Types or nonresidential sites in Tier 4 Place Types may include
existing tree canopy which overhangs existing underground utility
easements based upon adherence to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual and approval by the Chief Urban Forester.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8.</strong>  Tree save areas may include the planting of
small maturing trees in accordance with Duke Energy's, or its
successor's, approved planting list, within 25 feet of power
distribution lines. This allowance shall only be granted where planting
is in adherence with Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual
and approved by the Chief Urban Forester.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.</strong>  In local historic districts designated by a
Historic District Overlay (Section 14.1) and Neighborhood Character
Overlay Districts as designated by a Neighborhood Character Overlay
(Section 14.2), the requirements of overlay districts apply in addition
to the regulations of this section.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10. Tree Save Standards Overlap</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The following may be located within tree save areas when they meet
minimum requirements for this article and the articles listed below:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> 50% of the open space per Article 16 may be tree
save areas per Article 20, so long as such tree save area abuts the
remaining required open space and includes allowed amenities to provide
passive recreation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong>     Landscape yards per Article 20 if trees
planted or preserved are in addition to minimum tree save
requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong>     Water supply water quality buffers per
Article 23.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong>     Post-construction water quality buffers per

offered for dedication and accepted by Mecklenburg County Park and
Recreation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>11.</strong> The following additional standards apply only to
tree save areas for single-family, duplex, triplex, and quadraplex
residential development subject to approval of a subdivision per Article
30.3.A.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Additional Trees- Canopy Voids</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">In instances where tree save is used to meet green area requirements,
where groups of trees within a tree save area have gaps that are not
expected to fill in with time, as determined by the Chief Urban
Forester, additional trees shall be planted for the entire area to
qualify as tree save area, pursuant to approval by the Chief Urban
Forester. If root disturbance or construction activities occur within
the drip line of any tree designated as protected in the tree protection
plan, only the area being protected shall be included in the calculated
tree save area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.  Criteria for New Trees</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">New trees planted in common open spaces to satisfy the requisite tree
save area requirement shall be at least 0.75 inch caliper shade trees.
New trees planted within individual lots to satisfy the requirement
shall be at least 1.50 inch caliper trees.</p>
<p><strong>F. Land Dedication to Mecklenburg County Park and
Recreation</strong></p>

dedicating all of the land required for green area, a reduction in
minimum lot size by 10% would be allowed. This land shall be subject to
special agreement between the City and Park and Recreation, which shall
preserve 2/3 of the land as on-site tree save. Park land and tree save
shall be abutting.</p>
<p><strong>G. Payment-In-Lieu</strong></p>
<p>A payment may be made by a developer or a property owner to a City
administered tree preservation account, per item 1 below. The payment
shall be a percentage of the tax value of the land being developed
pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual. The tax
value of the land being developed shall not exceed 90% of the average
tax value of land in the City limits and of the ETJ, excluding the land
within the boundaries of I-77/I-277 and in accordance with the Charlotte
Tree Manual. The City shall update the average tax value of the land for
this formula with each County property revaluation. Payment-in-lieu may
be used for a portion of the required 15% green area or the entire
required green area in accordance with the requirements of this
section.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Collected monies from the green area
payment-in-lieu process per this item shall be deposited into the

pursuant to the Charlotte Tree Manual.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Existing large maturing shade trees two-inch
caliper or greater preserved between the building and the public street
right-of-way may be counted towards this requirement if they are
adequately protected during construction.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Trees planted in the public street right-of-way
to meet this requirement shall be a minimum of two-inch caliper. Large
maturing trees shall not be planted within 25 feet of overhead power
distribution. Small maturing trees may be planted where overhead power
distribution lines would interfere with normal growth of large maturing
trees. Large and small maturing trees shall not be planted within any
electric utility rights-of-way for overhead transmission lines, without
documented and confirmed authorization of the corresponding utility
provider.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Trees required by this section or protected as a
condition of a previously approved development plan, which die, are

30.3.A.</p>
<p><strong>2. Compliance</strong></p>
<p>The intent of tree planting compliance is for a site to reach full
compliance, even if an initial project(s) only requires proportional
compliance. Tree planting requirement compliance shall be achieved as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>a. Full Compliance</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Development activity that cumulatively impacts 75% or more of a site,
with cumulative impact considered for all development permitted on June
1, 2023 or later, shall fully comply with tree planting
requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Proportional Compliance</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The following development activities qualify for proportional
compliance with tree planting requirements when a site retains an
existing principal building and when there is less than 75% cumulative
disturbance of the site area:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Construction of an additional principal
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Expansion of an existing principal
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Removal and replacement of an existing
structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Expansion of existing built-upon area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Any combination of items i through iv above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sites qualifying for proportional compliance shall provide, at a
minimum, the same percentage of the required tree plantings as the
percentage of the site being disturbed by the subject development
activity.</p>
<p><strong>3. Exemptions.</strong> The following are exempt from the
requirements of this section as specified below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Increases in built-upon area (BUA) or building
coverage on lots where the existing principal structure is a
single-family detached home, duplex, triplex or quadraplex.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Construction of a new single-family detached
home, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex as a principal structure on a
single lot, unless such construction is any of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Part of an approval of a new subdivision as defined by Section
30.3.A or Section 30.3.D,</p></li>
<li><p>Constructed on three or more contiguous/adjacent lots,
or</p></li>
<li><p>Part of a multi-dwelling development.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Public infrastructure projects, such as road
expansion, public utility projects, and greenway trail construction,
undertaken by public entities unless such projects include increased
building coverage or parking lot expansion.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where public infrastructure projects are exempt from this section but
impact existing trees required or protected by Sections 20.14 through
20.17 or legacy versions of the Charlotte Tree Ordinance, such projects
shall be subject to interdepartmental agreements and land development
standards pursuant to the Charlotte Tree Manual.</p>
<p><strong>B.  General Requirements</strong></p>
