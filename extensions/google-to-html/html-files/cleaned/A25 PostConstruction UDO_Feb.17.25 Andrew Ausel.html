<h2>25.1 PURPOSE</h2>
<p>This article is intended to protect, maintain, and enhance the public
health, safety, environment, and welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased
post-construction stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution
associated with development and redevelopment. It has been determined
that proper management of construction-related and post-construction
stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property
and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare,
and protect water and aquatic resources. These regulations meet these
purposes through the following specific objectives and means:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Establishing decision-making processes for
development and redevelopment that protect the integrity of all
watersheds and preserve the health of water resources.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Minimizing changes to the pre-development
hydrologic response for development and redevelopment in their
post-construction state in accordance with the requirements of this
article for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding,
streambank erosion, and non-point and point source pollution, as well as
to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic habitats, and
healthy stream temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Establishing minimum post-construction stormwater
management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control
of stormwater runoff quantity and quality.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Establishing design and review criteria for the
construction, function, and use of structural stormwater control
facilities that may be used to meet the minimum post-construction
stormwater management standards.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Establishing criteria for the use of better
management and site design practices, such as the preservation of green
space and other conservation areas.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Establishing provisions for the long-term
responsibility for, and maintenance of, structural and nonstructural
stormwater control measures (SCMs) to ensure that they continue to
function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose minimum
risk to public safety.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Establishing administrative references and/or
procedures for the submission, review, approval, and disapproval of
stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects,
and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.</p>

<h2>25.4 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMIT APPROVAL
PROCESS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The Stormwater Management Permit is the development plan, as approved
by the Stormwater Administrator, that details how stormwater runoff will
be controlled through structural and/or nonstructural management
features.</p>
<p><strong>B. Submission of a Stormwater Management Plan</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. General</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A Stormwater Management Permit developed in accordance with the
specifications set forth in the Stormwater Regulations Administrative
Manual (Administrative Manual) shall be submitted to the City as part of
the plan for development or redevelopment and shall be reviewed in
accordance with established procedures.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Stormwater Management Permit Contents and
Form</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Stormwater Administrator shall establish requirements for the
content and form of the Stormwater Management Permit. These general
requirements shall be contained in the Administrative Manual, which may
be amended from time to time.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Permit Review Fees</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A fee, as established by City Council, shall accompany the submission
of the preliminary Stormwater Management Permit.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Complete Submission</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A Stormwater Management Permit will not be considered complete until
it contains all elements required by the Stormwater Administrator, along
with the appropriate fee. If the Stormwater Administrator finds that a
Stormwater Management Permit is incomplete, the applicant shall be
notified of the deficient elements and provided with an opportunity to
correct the plan. No review of a Stormwater Management Permit shall
commence until the Stormwater Administrator has determined the plan is
complete.</p>
<p><strong>C. Review and Approval of Stormwater Management
Plan</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Preparation by Professional Required</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The preliminary Stormwater Management Permit shall be prepared by a
licensed state professional engineer or registered landscape architect.
The professional engineer or registered landscape architect shall
certify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and
practices meets the requirements of these regulations.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Final Approval of Stormwater Management Plan</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If the Stormwater Administrator finds the Stormwater Management
Permit complies with the requirements of these regulations, the
Stormwater Administrator shall approve the Stormwater Management Permit,
which approval shall constitute the issuance of the permit. The
Stormwater Administrator may impose conditions of approval as needed to
ensure compliance with this article. The conditions shall be included in
the permit as part of the approval.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Effect of the Permit</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The permit shall remain valid for a period of three years from the
date of approval. If no work on the site in furtherance of the
Stormwater Management Permit has commenced within the three year period,
the permit and plan approval will become null and void and a new
application will be required to develop the site. If work on the site in
furtherance of the plan has commenced that involves any utility
installations or street improvements except grading, the permit and plan
shall remain valid and in force and the project may be completed in
accordance with the approved plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Disapproval of Stormwater Management Plan</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If the Stormwater Administrator disapproves the preliminary
Stormwater Management Permit, the grounds for such disapproval shall be
stated in writing to the applicant. After such disapproval, an appeal
from that decision may be taken to Stormwater Advisory Committee (SWAC).
SWAC may approve, disapprove, in whole or in part, or otherwise modify
the action of the Stormwater Administrator. A final Stormwater
Management Permit approved by SWAC, after appeal from the decision of
the Stormwater Administrator, will qualify as the permit.</p>
<p><strong>D. As-Built Plans and Final Approval</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> An applicant shall certify that the completed
project is in accordance with the approved Stormwater Management Permit
and designs and shall submit as-built plans for all stormwater
management facilities or practices after final construction is
completed. Failure to provide approved as-built plans within the
timeframe specified by the Stormwater Administrator may result in
assessment of penalties. At the discretion of the Stormwater
Administrator, performance guarantees may be required for stormwater
management facilities or practices until as-built plans are
approved.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> As-built plans shall show the final design
specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices
and the field location, size, depth, and planted vegetation of all
measures, controls, and devices, as installed. The designer of the
stormwater management measures and plans shall certify, under seal, that
the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices are in
compliance with the approved Stormwater Management Permit and designs
and with the requirements of this article. As conditions of the as-built
plan(s) approval, the designer shall submit a digital copy of the
as-built plan(s) as described in the Administrative Manual to the
Stormwater Administrator for the purpose of maintaining records,
performing inspections, maintenance and other future needs as determined
by the City.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Approved final as-built plans and a final
inspection by the Stormwater Administrator are required before a project
is determined to be in compliance with this article. At the discretion
of the Stormwater Administrator, certificates of occupancy may be
withheld pending receipt of as-built plans and the completion of a final
inspection and approval of a project.</p>
<h2>25.5 MITIGATION OPTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Total Phosphorus Mitigation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Purpose</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The purpose of this mitigation is to reduce the cost of complying
with the 70% total phosphorus removal criteria for development with
greater than or equal to 24% built-upon area while ensuring the
reduction of pollution loads and achievement of the objectives of this
article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. General Description</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> There are two total phosphorus mitigation options
available to development greater than or equal to 24% built-upon area:
1) an off-site mitigation option; and 2) a buy-down option as described
in this article. Both off-site and buy-down mitigation will result in
the construction of retrofit SCMs in the same river basin (Catawba or
Yadkin) as the mitigated site. In the Western Catawba District both
forms of mitigation shall occur in the watershed of the same named creek
system for the purpose of ensuring a balance of total phosphorus loads
to lake cove areas where phosphorus is a limiting pollutant with the
exception that up to 30% of the buy-down money can be spent outside the
watershed. In addition, the buy-down option is available provided the
City has projects and/or property available for mitigation. There is no
total phosphorus requirement in the Central Catawba District so the
mitigation option is not necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The named creek (or drainage basin) systems
referred to above include:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Western Catawba: Studman Branch, Porter Branch,
Neal Branch, Stowe Branch, Beaverdam Creek, Little Paw Creek, Paw Creek,
Long Creek, Gar Creek, and the Lower Mountain Island watershed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Yadkin-Southeast Catawba: Six Mile Creek, Twelve
Mile Creek, Caldwell Creek, McKee Creek, Reedy Creek, Fuda Creek, Back
Creek, Mallard Creek, and Lower Clarke Creek.</p>
<p><strong>3. Criteria for Off-Site Mitigation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The owner or designee of a proposed construction
site that will include greater than or equal to 24% BUA shall construct
SCM retrofit project designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net
mass removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70% of
the total phosphorus from the proposed site. Off-site mitigation is
allowed only for total phosphorus removal above 50%. On-site SCMs shall
be constructed to achieve 50% removal of total phosphorus from the
project site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The Stormwater Administrator shall receive and
review the application for off-site mitigation. After reviewing the
application the Stormwater Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or
approve with conditions an “Application for Off-Site Total Phosphorus
Mitigation.” This application shall be submitted with the Stormwater
Management Permit application and shall at a minimum contain a
description of the SCM(s) to be constructed, including their type and
size as well as the pollutant removal efficiencies to be achieved. The
location of the site where the SCM(s) are to be constructed shall be
described, including the size of the drainage area to be treated and
percentage and type of existing BUA. The application shall also include
the pounds of total phosphorus being mitigated for and the pounds of
total phosphorus reduced with the retrofit SCM(s). Documentation shall
be submitted with the application to demonstrate that the applicant has
land rights to perform the SCM retrofit on the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The criteria for approval of off-site total
phosphorus mitigation by the Stormwater Administrator are as
follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> SCM(s) shall be constructed in accordance with
15A NCAC 2H.1008(c), as explained in the SCM Design Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> SCM(s) shall be sized for the corresponding
watershed area according to the SCM Design Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> SCM(s) shall be inspected by the Stormwater
Administrator and found to be in compliance with all approved plans and
specifications prior to the issuance of certificate(s) of occupancy for
the mitigated site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Following approval from the Stormwater
Administrator, SCM(s) may be installed and credits obtained for pounds
of total phosphorus removed that can be applied to future projects.
These credits can be accumulated or banked for a period of time as
specified by the Stormwater Administrator in the Administrative
Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> All off-site mitigation SCMs shall be subject to
the maintenance requirements as well as installation and maintenance
performance securities specified in Section 25.7.</p>
<p><strong>4. Criteria for Total Phosphorus Buy-Down Option</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The owner or designee of a proposed construction
site that will include greater than or equal to 24% BUA may buy-down the
70% phosphorus removal requirement to no less than 50%. On-site SCMs
shall be installed to remove the remaining total phosphorus load. The
funds shall be used by the City to construct SCM retrofit projects
designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total
phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70% of the total phosphorus
from the proposed site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The Stormwater Administrator shall receive and
review the application for the buy-down option. After receiving the
application the Stormwater Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or
approve with conditions an application for total phosphorus buy-down.
This application shall be submitted with the Stormwater Management
Permit application and shall at a minimum contain calculations showing
the total load buy-down and all cost calculations as described in the
Administrative Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The criteria for the buy-down option are as
follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The buy-down option shall not be approved by the
Stormwater Administrator unless projects and/or properties are available
for mitigation, including SCM construction, SCM maintenance, SCM
rehabilitation, and stream restoration.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> There is no time constraint for the City to
spend mitigation funds. However, the City shall strive to spend funds
collected in a timely and efficient manner such that a net improvement
in water quality results.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The City shall ensure that the function of all
SCMs constructed by the City as part of this mitigation option shall be
maintained in perpetuity. Individual maintenance responsibilities are
further defined in project specific easement agreements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> The criteria for calculating the buy-down cost
shall be provided in the Administrative Manual.</p>
<h2>25.6 DEED RECORDATION AND PLAT SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The approval of the Stormwater Management Permit
shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs
with the land, such as a plat, recorded deed restrictions or protective
covenants, to ensure that future development maintains the site in a
manner consistent with the approved project plans.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Streams and buffer boundaries, including the
delineation of each buffer zone, shall be specified on all surveys and
record plats.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The applicable operations and maintenance
agreement pertaining to every SCM shall be referenced on the final plat
and shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds
Office upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for
the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement shall be
recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office so as to
appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under
generally accepted searching principles.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> A copy of the recorded operations and maintenance
agreement shall be provided to the Stormwater Administrator within 14
days following receipt of the recorded document. A maintenance easement
shall be recorded for every SCM to allow sufficient access for adequate
maintenance. The specific recordation and deed restriction requirements,
as well as notes to be displayed on final plats and deeds, shall be
contained in the Administrative Manual.</p>
