<p><strong>Article 24. Drainage</strong></p>
<h2>24.1 PURPOSE</h2><h2>24.2 APPLICABILITY</h2><h2>24.3 STORM DRAINAGE STANDARDS</h2><h2>24.4 ADMINISTRATION</h2><h2>24.5 STORMWATER ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
<h2>24.1 PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The regulations for storm drainage are intended, to the maximum
extent practicable, to allow for the lawful and orderly development of
lands within the City and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) while
managing stormwater responsibly. Specifically, they are intended to:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Coordinate site drainage to protect existing and
proposed buildings and structures.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Coordinate storm drainage infrastructure with
existing or planned streets or public facilities.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Create a storm drainage network that facilitates
development of an entire neighborhood or area of the City.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Preserve and enhance the quality of the City’s
natural features and natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Protect the public health, safety, and welfare
with respect to stormwater drainage.</p>
<h2>24.2 APPLICABILITY</h2>
<p>All development, including any affiliated construction and/or
installation of storm drainage, within the City and its ETJ shall
provide adequate drainage controls and conveyance in accordance with
this section. The following activities require a storm drainage plan and
permit approved by Storm Water Services:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Construction or expansion of any building,
structure, driveway, street, or parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Installation, modification, creation, or
connection of any of the following items within a stormwater-related
easement recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds or
within the right-of-way of a publicly maintained street. Stormwater
related easement, for the purposes of this article includes, but is not
limited to, storm drainage easements (SDE), public storm drainage
easements (PSDE), and conservation easements:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Storm drainage pipes, catch basin, manhole
structures, ditches, swales, curb and gutter, or other similar
items.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> New driveway aprons or modifications to existing
driveway aprons with driveway pipes on existing ditch-type streets or
with a catch basin located within ten feet of driveway.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Retaining walls or privacy/screening walls.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Installation, modification, creation, or
connection of storm drainage pipes, catch basins, manhole structures,
ditches, swales, curb and gutter, or similar items that convey runoff
from a publicly maintained street.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Land disturbance to perform cut, fill, or
recontouring of the land that will modify or impact existing surface
drainage features or patterns.</p>
<h2>24.3 STORM DRAINAGE STANDARDS</h2>
<p>All land disturbing activities shall provide adequate storm drainage
in accordance with this article sufficient to achieve purposes as
outlined in Section 24.1 above. Persons conducting the land disturbing
activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and
private property from damage caused by such activity and associated
storm drainage.</p>
<p><strong>A. Encroachments</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Unless otherwise approved by the Stormwater
Administrator, buildings, additions, accessory structures, other
permanent structures, including but not limited to swimming pools,
retaining walls, and brick walls, shall:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Not be allowed within a stormwater-related
easement.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Not be allowed within 7.5 feet of the centerline
of storm drainage pipes that convey runoff from a public street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Additional requirements may apply to this minimum
standard where there are conditions such as deep pipes, building
foundation load plane influence above or into the side of a pipe, or
other engineering or maintenance concerns. The City may require a
cross-section plot that demonstrates that the building foundation load
plane crosses below any adjacent existing or proposed storm pipes. If
determined to be necessary, any of the following may be required as
determined by the Stormwater Administrator:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> The minimum required distance of the structure
from the piped underground storm drainage may be expanded.  </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> An extended (deep) footer may be required to
ensure that the load plane is moved below the pipe.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Not be allowed within ten feet of the centerline
of a storm drainage ditch, swale or channel that conveys runoff from a
public street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Unless otherwise approved by the Stormwater
Administrator, it shall be unlawful to obstruct or in any way interfere
or conflict with storm drainage located in a street right-of-way or
within an SDE. The City may require the property owner or person
responsible for the obstruction to remove it within a reasonable period.
The City shall take into consideration the technology, quantity of work
required, degree of risk or harm, and shall set reasonable and
attainable time limits. The City may, at its option, remove an
obstruction and charge the expense of the removal, restoration, and
repair to the person who places or maintains the obstruction.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> If any part of a proposed lot or development
connects to an existing drainage system within a street right-of-way or
within a stormwater-related easement, construction methods and materials
within the street right-of-way or within a stormwater-related easement
shall meet the City’s requirements, which may be satisfied using details
provided in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM) or
other designs reviewed and approved by the Stormwater Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>B. Management of Stormwater Runoff and
Conveyance</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Storm drainage shall be provided to allow for the
disposal of surface water runoff. To the maximum extent practicable,
storm drainage shall function to protect streets, buildings and
structures, and to provide positive drainage for all developed and
graded areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Drainage of any surface on the property, whether
pervious or impervious, shall not be discharged in a manner that creates
flooding.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Land disturbing activities shall not restrict or
block the storm drainage so as to obstruct or interrupt the natural flow
of waters on the property, create standing water thereon, or cause
flooding of neighboring properties. Grading activities shall not block
the natural flow of drainage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> New or modified storm drainage that conveys
runoff from a publicly-maintained street shall comply the City’s
requirements, which may be satisfied using designs contained in the
current edition of the CLDSM and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water
Services Design Manual or other designs reviewed and approved by the
Stormwater Administrator. Where existing public or private storm
drainage is reasonably available, the new or modified storm drainage
shall connect to the existing public or private storm drainage
(including all grading and structures necessary to properly connect).
When connecting to existing storm drainage systems on another property,
good faith efforts shall be made to obtain permission for offsite work.
If improving an existing drainage system to meet standards creates
adverse hydraulic impacts on the upstream or downstream drainage system,
the City may allow alternatives.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Storm drainage that meets the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services Design Manual shall be
provided throughout a subdivision.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong> Storm drainage installed or modified that conveys
runoff from a publicly maintained street shall provide an SDE. The
widths for SDE’s shall meet the City’s requirements. The CLDSM shows
acceptable minimum widths for easements. The SDE shall be shown on a
plat for the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The purpose of the SDE is to provide stormwater conveyance. Buildings
are not permitted in the SDE area. Any other objects that impede storm
water flow or system maintenance are also prohibited. Maintenance of the
storm drainage within the easement is the responsibility of the property
owner unless conveyed to and accepted by the City of Charlotte or
Mecklenburg County.</p>
<p><strong>C. Properties Subject to Flooding</strong></p>
<p>All streams in the City that drain one square mile or greater are
regulated by the floodplain regulations of Article 27. However, flooding
also occurs in areas that drain less than one square mile. This section
applies to those areas not regulated by Article 27 that are expected to
drain 50 cubic feet (50ft<sup>3</sup>) per second or more for the
100-year storm (hereinafter referred to as “properties subject to
flooding”).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> An applicant shall be required to determine the
100-year (1%) flood elevation where any part of an existing property or
proposed lot is subject to flooding, and construction of any new
habitable building or structure, or an expansion to an existing
habitable building or structure is proposed. The 100-year (1%) flood
elevation shall include all areas of the site where a flood has a 1%
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year in accordance with
generally accepted engineering practice, which is to be submitted with
the seal and signature of a Licensed Professional Engineer as part of
the storm drainage plan. The elevation one foot above the 100-year (1%)
flood elevation shall be known and identified as the “100+1 Stormwater
Elevation Line (SWEL).”</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> All habitable buildings or structures shall be
located outside the SWEL or the lowest usable and functional part of the
building or structure shall not be below the Stormwater Protection
Elevation (SWPE). “Usable and functional part of the building or
structure” shall be defined as being inclusive of, but not limited to,
living areas, basements, sunken dens, basement utility rooms,
crawlspaces, attached carports, attached garages and mechanical
appurtenances such as furnaces, air conditioners, water pumps,
electrical conduits and wiring, but shall not include water lines or
sanitary sewer traps, piping and clean-outs, provided openings serving
the structure are above the SWPE.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> No proposed property that is wholly or partly
subject to flooding shall be approved unless the SWEL is established on
the final plat by field survey. Such line shall be known and identified
on the final plat as the “100+1 Stormwater Elevation Line (SWEL).” In
addition, the SWPE for each property subject to flooding shall be noted
on the plan and plat based on, either of the following, whichever is
greater:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The SWEL; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> For properties upstream of street crossings, the
low elevation of the street plus one foot.</p>
<p>Also, the plat for all properties subject to flooding shall include
the following note:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"This property is subject to flooding during heavy rainfall, and
the construction of buildings or structures below the stormwater
protection elevation is prohibited.”</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> The Stormwater Administrator may waive this
requirement if all of the following conditions exist:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The SWEL does not exceed the required minimum
front, side, or rear setback line.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The estimated runoff or proposed modifications to
a storm water conveyance would not create a hazard for the adjacent
properties or residents.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The flood limits would not be of such magnitude
that adjacent property owners should be informed of these limits.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Subdivisions</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">For subdivisions, where only a portion of a proposed lot is subject
to flooding as defined herein, such lot may be approved only if there
will be available for building a usable lot area of not less than 1,200
square feet. The usable lot area shall be determined by deducting from
the total lot area the area of all setbacks required by the applicable
zoning district regulations and any remaining area of the lot lying
below the SWEL.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">During the construction of a subdivision, the developer shall
maintain the streambed of each stream, creek, or backwash channel
contiguous to the subdivision in an unobstructed state and shall remove
from the channel and banks of the stream all debris, logs, timber, junk
and other accumulations of a nature that would, in time of flood, clog
or dam the passage of waters in their downstream course. Installation of
appropriately sized stormwater drains, culverts, bridges or erosion
control devices will not be construed as obstructions in the stream.</p>
