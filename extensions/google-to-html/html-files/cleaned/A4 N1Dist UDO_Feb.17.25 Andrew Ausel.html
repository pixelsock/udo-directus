<h1 id="purpose">4.1 PURPOSE </h1>
<p>The Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts respect the character and
development patterns of Charlotte’s established residential
neighborhoods and promote new residential neighborhood development in a
manner that implements the City’s vision for the future. The N1-A
through N1-E Zoning Districts allow for the development of
single-family, duplex, and triplex dwellings on all lots. Additionally,
quadraplex dwellings are allowed on arterial streets in these zoning
districts when an affordable housing unit is provided within the
dwelling. The N1-F Zoning District allows all dwelling types allowed in
N1-A through N1-E Zoning Districts, as well as small-scale multi-family
dwellings, and is intended for application typically on arterial streets
within Neighborhood 1 Place Type.</p>
<p>Specific standards within each of the zoning districts address
building form and promote context-sensitive, compatible neighborhood
development. The Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts also allow for select
nonresidential uses, such as places of worship and educational
facilities, and for the reuse of existing neighborhood commercial
establishments under prescribed conditions.</p>

buildings in the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts.</p>
<p><strong>NONRESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE BUILDING DESIGN
STANDARDS</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A frontage shall have a minimum of one prominent
entrance, as defined in this Ordinance. This does not apply to Limited
Access roads. The number of prominent entrances required shall be
determined by the building length along the frontage and the maximum
spacing in F of Table 4-4.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> In the case of a building with two frontages
located on a corner, one prominent entrance located on the corner may
count as a required prominent entrance for both frontages, subject to
the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> A prominent corner entry shall include design
features that reinforce intersections as key locations for pedestrian
activity. Two of the following shall be included:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> A chamfered or rounded corner design.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> Awnings, canopies, or other covered entry

<h1 id="alternative-residential-development-options">4.5 ALTERNATIVE
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS</h1>
<p class="heading Style2" id="a.-conservation-residential-development">A. Conservation Residential
Development </p>
<p>A conservation residential development permits a reduction in minimum
lot size in exchange for the provision and conservation of green area
and common open space beyond the requirements of this Ordinance. The
purpose of the conservation residential development standards is to
protect open space and/or natural resources and features through
alternative development standards. The intent of the conservation
residential development standards of this Section is to emphasize the
importance of the conservation of natural areas and important habitats,
enhance surface water quality, maintain and enhance tree canopy and
provide useable common open space for residents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Applicability</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Conservation residential development is permitted in the N1-A, N1-B,
and N1-C Zoning Districts. A conservation residential development site
shall be a minimum of five acres. The conservation residential
development provisions shall not be paired with the Voluntary Mixed
Income incentives of Section 4.5.B. or the Compact Residential
Development option of Section 4.5.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Development Standards</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where there are comparable development standards in the N1-A, N1-B,
and N1-C Zoning Districts, the development standards below replace those
development standards. All other applicable UDO standards apply unless
stated otherwise.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Site Layout</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> All lots within a conservation residential
development shall front a public street, common open space, or green
area. All applicable emergency access requirements must be met
regardless of lot frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> A 25 foot Class B landscape yard shall be
provided along the perimeter of a conservation residential development
site, except for where the site abuts an existing public street or
network required private street. The perimeter landscape yard shall not
be in a lot or sublot and shall not count toward any required common
open space. As an alternative, a 30 foot perimeter landscape yard that
meets the planting standards of a Class B landscape yard per Table 20-2
may be counted toward green area credits if the standards of Section
20.15.E (Tree Save Standards) are also met.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The maximum number of lots permitted within a
conservation residential development is determined by the gross acreage
of the site, exclusive of the rights-of-way for existing public streets,
divided by the minimum lot area of the zoning district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Lots within the conservation residential
development shall meet the standard lot requirements of the underlying
zoning district with the exception of the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Minimum lot area and minimum lot width may be

of 5,000 square feet or less.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Minimum setbacks apply as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> A minimum side setback of five feet applies to
all lots within a conservation residential development.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> A minimum corner side setback of ten feet
applies to all corner lots within a conservation residential
development.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> Front and rear setbacks may be reduced by 50%
for all lots within the conservation residential development, unless
otherwise specified below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> Where a lot within a conservation residential
development fronts on a common open space or green area, the front
setback shall be five feet behind the property line abutting the common
open space or green area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a garage is accessed from an alley and
parking is not located between the garage and alley, the garage shall be
located between five and seven feet from the edge of pavement of an
alley. Where parking spaces are located between a garage and an alley,
the garage shall be located at least 20 feet from the edge of pavement
of the alley.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> The driveway requirements of Section 19.6.A.1
are applicable in a conservation residential development unless
otherwise noted in this Section.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(G)</strong> Where a lot within the conservation residential
development abuts a public or network-required private street at the
perimeter of the conservation residential development, minimum front
setback and minimum lot width shall be in accordance with the underlying
zoning district requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(H)</strong> Where common open space abuts a public or
network-required private street at the perimeter of a conservation
residential development, the minimum front setback and minimum lot width
for any lot fronting on this common open space shall be in accordance
with the underlying zoning district requirements.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> Alleys where all lots on at least one side of
the alley front a public street are not limited in length. Alleys shall
not exceed 200 feet in length for the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Lots on both sides of the alley front on common
open space or green area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> Lots on one side of the alley front on common
open space or green area and no residential lots exist on the opposite
side of the alley.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vii.</strong> In addition to any required parking, the
conservation residential development shall provide one visitor parking
space for every four units in the development site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Any required visitor parking spaces may be
satisfied through on-street parking or one or more common parking
lots.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> No common parking lot shall contain more than
ten parking spaces.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Conservation Protection Area</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> A minimum of 40% of a conservation residential
development shall comprise conservation protection area. For the
conservation protection area, 30% of the overall site shall be green
area and 10% of the overall site shall be common open space. The 30%
green area shall be inclusive of the base 15% requirement for green area
per Section 20.15.D. The standards of Table 16-2 for common open space
do not apply for conservation residential development. Additional
standards for green area and common open space are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Green area credits shall be used to achieve
required green area. Green area credits are based on the corresponding
multipliers for each credit and found in Table 20-5.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> Trees on private lots or sublots shall not count
toward required green area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> Dimensions of required green areas are subject
to the requirements of Section 20.15.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> Green areas fronted by residential lots shall
have a minimum width of 50 feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> Required common open space areas need not be
contiguous, but each common open space area shall have a minimum
dimension of at least 50 feet in all dimensions.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> All required common open space areas shall have
a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a public street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(G)</strong> At least one common open space area shall be
accessible from all residential lots in the conservation residential
development within a 1,000 foot radius of the common open space area.
This radius is measured in a straight line from the lot line, without
regard for street, sidewalk or trail connections, to the nearest point
of the open space. Multiple common open space areas may be needed to
meet this requirement.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(H)</strong> Easements for above-ground utilities located
within the site area shall not count toward required common open
space.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(I)</strong> The required common open space shall be improved
for either active or passive use.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> The required common open space area shall be
improved with grass, live groundcover, shrubs, plants, trees, or usable
outdoor hardscape features, such as courtyards, walkways, seating areas,
patios, or fountains/water features.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> Usable outdoor amenities, such as grills, pools,
tennis courts, or playgrounds, are permitted as part of the required
common open space area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(J)</strong> No more than 25% of the required common open
space area shall be covered by water. These bodies of water shall not be
part of a stormwater control measure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(K)</strong> Residential lots fronting common open space per
Section 2.a.i. above shall provide perimeter trees at a rate of one
large maturing tree for every 40 feet of lot width. Perimeter trees may
be located anywhere within the common open space area abutting said lots
and need not be arranged along the edge of the open space, subject to
the tree planting requirements of Section 20.17.B.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(L)</strong> Structures located within any required common
open space shall be accessory to any recreational use of the space.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(M)</strong> Structures located in designated green areas
shall be subject to the requirements of Article 20.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(N)</strong> Retaining walls in required common open space
areas shall be limited to five feet in height. Retaining walls are not
permitted within 10 feet of a green area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(O)</strong> Landscape yards shall not be located on private
lots or sublots.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Green area and common open space may be conveyed
as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> To Mecklenburg County in support of the
Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Department, if accepted by the
County.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> To a conservation organization approved by the
City, if accepted by the designated organization.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> To one or more homeowner’s associations.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Green area and common open space shall not be
sold.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Green area and common open space shall have no
development rights except when these areas are improved for active or
passive recreational purposes.</p>
<p class="heading Style2" id="b.-voluntary-mixed-income-residential-development">B. Voluntary
Mixed-Income Residential Development</p>
<p>A voluntary mixed-income residential development allows for an
increase in development intensity in exchange for the provision of a
mixture of affordable and market-rate housing units, expanding housing
options and opportunities within the City. The voluntary mixed-income
residential development provisions shall not be paired with the
conservation residential development incentives of Section 4.5.A.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Applicability</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Voluntary mixed-income residential development is permitted in the
N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D Zoning Districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Development Bonus</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">In exchange for setting aside affordable housing units, voluntary
mixed-income residential developments may receive a bonus allowing for
the development of property in accordance with the standards of a zoning
district of greater intensity as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Property zoned the N1-A Zoning District may be
developed in accordance with the standards</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">of the N1-C Zoning District.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Property zoned the N1-B Zoning District may be
developed in accordance with the standards</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">of the N1-D Zoning District.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Property zoned the N1-C Zoning District may be
developed in accordance with the standards</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">of the N1-E Zoning District.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Property zoned the N1-D Zoning District may be
developed in accordance with the standards</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">of the N1-E Zoning District.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>An example of a calculation of bonus lots is as follows: If the
N1-A Zoning District allows 100 lots and the N1-C Zoning District allows
167 lots, then there are 67 bonus lots. (167 lots minus 100
lots).</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Affordability Set-Aside</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> All units constructed on 50% of the bonus lots
accommodated through the development bonus shall be developed as
affordable units set aside for households earning 80% Area Median Income
(AMI) or less. The period of affordability shall be 15 years for rental
properties and the City or a nonprofit shall have first right of refusal
for for-sale properties.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> AMI averaging is permitted; however, no unit
designated as affordable shall be set aside for households earning more
than 100% AMI.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> For lots on arterial streets, any affordable
units required for a quadraplex dwelling are in addition to the required
number of affordable units in item a above.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Development Standards</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A minimum contiguous development site of one acre
is required for a voluntary mixed-income residential development. No
fewer than two affordable units may be developed as part of a voluntary
mixed-income development receiving a development bonus.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Development standards applicable to a voluntary
mixed-income development shall be those of the zoning district achieved
through the development bonus.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Affordable housing units provided as a component
of the voluntary mixed-income residential development shall be
distributed throughout the development, not concentrated in any one
structure or area of the site, unless the total affordable housing units
in the development is five or fewer.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Compliance and Monitoring</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Voluntary mixed-income residential developments are subject to
monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the standards of this
section, and in accordance with Section 2.1 of the UDO Zoning
Administration Manual.</p>
<p><strong>C. Compact Residential Development</strong></p>
<p>A compact residential development permits a reduction in lot size and
setbacks in exchange for the provision of common open space beyond the
requirements of this Ordinance. The purpose of these compact residential
development standards is to align residential development standards with
current development and design patterns to support increased access to
housing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Applicability</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Compact residential development is permitted in
the N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D Zoning Districts. A compact residential
development site shall include at least one parcel with a minimum size
of two acres as of June 1, 2023. If the site does not include at least
one parcel of two acres or more, assembly of multiple parcels into a
parcel of two acres or more is allowed when either of the following
conditions are met:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> At least one of the parcels in the assemblage has
frontage on an arterial street of four lanes or more, per the Charlotte
Streets Map.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The assemblage includes no more than three
separate parcels to achieve the minimum two-acre requirement. If the
minimum two-acre requirement is met, additional parcels may be added to
the assemblage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The compact residential development option shall
not be used on a parcel, or a portion thereof, included in the 65 DNL
contour on the most recently published Airport Noise Exposure Map for
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, nor the Critical and Protected
Watershed Areas (Article 23).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The compact residential development provisions
shall not be paired with the Conservation Residential Development option
of Section 4.5.A or the Voluntary Mixed Income incentives of Section
4.5.B.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Development Standards</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where there are comparable development standards in the N1-A, N1-B,
N1-C, and N1-D zoning districts, the development standards below replace
those development standards. All other applicable UDO standards apply
unless otherwise stated.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Site Layout</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> All lots within a compact residential development
shall front a public street or common open space. However, no more than
30% of residential lots on the development site shall front on common
open space. All applicable emergency access requirements must be met
regardless of lot frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> A 25 foot Class B landscape yard shall be
provided along the perimeter of a compact residential development site
where the site abuts the Neighborhood 1 Place Type, except for where the
site abuts an existing public street or network required private street.
The perimeter landscape yard shall not be in a lot or sublot and shall
not count toward any required common open space. As an alternative, a 30
foot perimeter landscape yard that meets the planting standards of a
Class B landscape yard per Table 20-2 may be counted toward green area
credits if the standards of Section 20.15.E (Tree Save Standards) are
also met.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> No landscape yard is required between lots
fronting an external street and abutting property in a Neighborhood 1
Place Type. This allowance does not exempt a compact residential
development from the landscape yard requirements of Sections 20.10 and
20.11.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Lots within a compact residential development
shall meet the following standards:</p>
