<h2>28.3 REQUIREMENTS, OBJECTIVES, AND STANDARDS</h2>
<p><strong>A. General Requirements</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">All land-disturbing activities, including those that disturb less
than an acre, shall provide adequate erosion control measures,
structures, or devices in accordance with this article sufficient to
retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the
boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the
tract.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Plan Required</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">No person shall initiate, direct, allow, or conduct any
land-disturbing activity on a tract that meets any of the following
criteria without having a copy of an erosion and sedimentation control
plan (hereinafter referred to as “plan”) on the job site approved by the
City:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Uncovers one acre or more. In determining the
size of the disturbed area, lands being developed as a unit shall be
aggregated regardless of ownership.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> In borrow and waste areas covered by item D.6
below, with a disturbed area one acre or greater.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Compliance</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Plans submitted to the Stormwater Administrator shall comply with
this section and Section 28.4 of this article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Protection of Property</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable
measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused
by such activity and associated sedimentation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Conflicts; Applicability of More Restrictive
Rules</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Whenever conflicts exist between the regulations in this article and
federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more
restrictive provision shall apply.</p>
<p><strong>B. Basic Control Objectives</strong></p>
<p>A plan shall include adequate erosion control measures, structures,
or devices to address the following control objectives:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Identify Critical Areas</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">On-site areas that are subject to severe erosion and off-site areas
that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or
sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Limit Time of Exposure</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">All land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to limit
exposure to the shortest feasible time.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Limit Exposed Areas</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">All land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to
minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Control Surface Water</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be
controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of
exposure.</p>
<p><strong>5. Control Sedimentation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">All land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to
prevent sedimentation damage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Manage Stormwater Runoff</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from
a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of
the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the
velocity at the discharge point so as to minimize accelerated erosion of
the site and to decrease sedimentation to any lake or watercourse.</p>
<p><strong>C. Mandatory Standards for Land-Disturbing
Activity</strong></p>
<p>No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this article
shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Lake, Watercourse and Wetland Protection</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Additional erosion control measures, structures, or devices as
specified in the City and Mecklenburg County Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Policies and Procedures statement issued by the
Stormwater Administrator shall be required to provide a higher level of
protection to lakes, watercourses, and wetlands from sedimentation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Graded Slopes and Fills</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the
angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate
erosion control measures, structures, or devices. In any event, slopes
left exposed shall, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase
of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent
groundcover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The
angle for graded slopes and fills shall be demonstrated to be stable.
Stable is the condition where the soil remains in its original
configuration, with or without mechanical constraints.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Fill Material</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with those described
in the North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) per 15A NCAC 13B .0562
unless the site is permitted by the North Carolina Department of
Environmental Quality (hereinafter referred to as NCDEQ) Division of
Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all materials described
in 15A NCAC 13B .0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical
considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated
accordingly.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Groundcover</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract, the
person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install erosion and
sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to
retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the
boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said
tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent groundcover
sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or
development. Provisions for a permanent groundcover sufficient to
restrain erosion shall be accomplished within 21 calendar days following
completion of construction or development. For an area of a site that is
inactive for a period of 21 calendar days or longer, temporary
groundcover shall be required</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Prior Plan Approval</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if
one acre or more is to be disturbed unless a plan for that activity has
been submitted and approved in accordance with Section 28.4.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Pre-Construction Conference</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If one acre or more is to be uncovered, the person conducting
land-disturbing activity, or an agent of that person shall contact the
Stormwater Administrator at least 48 hours before commencement of the
land-disturbing activity. The purpose is to arrange an on-site meeting
with the Stormwater Administrator to review and discuss the approved
plan and the proposed land-disturbing activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Monitoring</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The landowner, financially responsible party, person conducting
land-disturbing activity, or an agent of those persons, shall inspect
all erosion and sedimentation control measures at least once a week and
within 24 hours after any storm event of greater than one inch of rain
per 24 hour period, or more frequently if required by federal or state
law. The person performing this monitoring shall have certification or
commensurate training and experience approved by the Stormwater
Administrator.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> If one acre or more is to be disturbed, a record
of inspections shall be kept by the person conducting the
land-disturbing activity, or an agent of that person, until six months
after construction is completed and grading permit termination is
approved by the Stormwater Administrator. The record shall include all
monitoring and inspection elements as required by the North Carolina
General Permit, NCG01 (NCG01). Additional record keeping may be required
by federal or state law and as stated on the approved plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Corrective action for repairs and maintenance
indicated on the record shall be initiated within 24 hours after a rain
event or within 24 hours of the last inspection if a rain event did not
prompt the inspection, unless additional time is allowed by the
Stormwater Administrator. The date of the completion of such repairs
shall be noted. The records of inspection shall be made available to the
Stormwater Administrator upon request.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Persons who have had a notice of violation or
repeated warning about off-site sedimentation or non-maintenance of
adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices may be
required to provide the Stormwater Administrator with a self-inspection
record for the particular tract.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8. Sedimentation Control</strong> <strong>Buffer</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">No land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or
improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or
watercourse unless a sedimentation control buffer zone is provided along
the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible
siltation within the 25% of the sedimentation control buffer zone
nearest the land-disturbing activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Projects On, Over, or Under Water</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">This sedimentation control buffer requirement shall not apply to a
land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of
facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or watercourse.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Sedimentation Control</strong> <strong>Buffer
Measurement</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Unless otherwise provided, the width of a sedimentation control
buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the
nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the
land-disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of
confining visible siltation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9. Adherence to Approved Plans</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in accordance with
the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.</p>
<p><strong>D. Design and Performance Standards</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Design Storm</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Adequate erosion control measures, structures, and devices shall be
planned, designed, constructed and maintained so as to provide
protection from the calculated maximum peak of runoff from the 10-year
storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the
USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service's (formerly Soil
Conservation Service’s) National Engineering Field Manual for
Conservation Practices, or other acceptable calculation procedures
including, but not limited to, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water
Services Design Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Innovative Measures</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Erosion and sedimentation measures applied alone or in combination to
satisfy the intent of this article are acceptable if they are sufficient
to prevent adverse secondary consequences. Innovative techniques and
ideas shall be considered and may be used following approval by the
Stormwater Administrator if it can be demonstrated that such techniques
and ideas are likely to produce successful results.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Responsibility for Maintenance</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">During the development of a tract, the person conducting the
land-disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and
permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the
approved plan or any section of this article, The North Carolina
Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 and all rules and orders
adopted pursuant to it (referred to as “Act’ within this article), or
any order adopted pursuant to this article or the Act. After
development, the landowner or person in possession or control of the
land shall install and maintain all necessary permanent erosion and
sediment control measures.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Additional Measures</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Whenever the Stormwater Administrator determines that accelerated
erosion and sedimentation continues or shall likely continue, despite
installation and maintenance of protective practices, the person
conducting the land-disturbing activity shall be required to take
additional protective action necessary to achieve compliance with the
conditions specified in this article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Storm Drainage Facilities Protection</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Persons shall design the plan and conduct land-disturbing activity so
that the post-construction velocity of the 10-year storm does not exceed
the maximum nonerosive velocity tolerated by the soil of the receiving
watercourse or the soil of the receiving land.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Borrow and Waste Areas</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If the same person conducts the land-disturbing activity and any
related borrow or waste activity, the related borrow or waste activity
shall constitute part of the land-disturbing activity, unless the borrow
or waste activity is regulated under the Mining Act of 1971, N.C.G.S.
74, Article 7, or is a landfill regulated by the Division of Waste
Management. If the land-disturbing activity and any related borrow or
waste activity are not conducted by the same person, they shall be
considered by the approving authority as separate land-disturbing
activities.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Temporary Access and Haul Roads</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed
or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be
considered a part of such activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8. Operations in Lakes or Watercourses</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on,
over, or under a lake or watercourse shall be planned and conducted in
such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disruption of
the stream channel. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an
essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed
so as to minimize changes in the stream flow
characteristics<del>.</del></p>
