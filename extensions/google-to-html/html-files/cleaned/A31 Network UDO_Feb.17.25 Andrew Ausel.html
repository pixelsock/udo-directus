<h2>31.1 BLOCK AND NETWORK DESIGN STANDARDS</h2>
<p>This section contains specifications for street networks, external
connectivity, internal connectivity, block length, cross-access, and
driveway and street access.</p>
<p><strong>A. Street Network</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> A network of interconnected public streets
providing both external and internal connectivity is required for new
development. The Subdivision, Streets, and Infrastructure Administrator
(SSI Administrator), in consultation with the Charlotte Department of
Transportation (CDOT), may allow network-required private streets for
external and/or internal connectivity in consideration of the conditions
below. Any such network-required private street shall have a recorded
public access easement.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Site conditions require street geometry not
allowed for a public street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> A public street is not needed to enhance the
existing public street network.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The proposed street does not stub into an
adjacent property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> The proposed street does not connect to an
existing street on an adjacent property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> A Charlotte Water line that connects to an
adjacent property is not located or proposed to be located within the
street right-of-way.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Cemeteries, places of worship, and educational
facilities are exempt from the street network requirements.</p>
<p>However, if any of these uses are part of a mixed-use development,
this exemption shall not apply.</p>
<p><strong>B. External Connectivity</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Existing Street Stubs</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Existing adjacent street stubs shall be extended
into the development on the stub street’s proper projection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Any existing and abutting paper street stubs
shall be extended into the development on the stub street’s proper
projection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Block Length</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Requirements for additional new collector and local streets shall be
determined as follows, using the preferred block length for the
applicable Place Type.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The following process shall determine the
required number of blocks along the boundary of the development:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Step 1</u>. Identify the applicable Place Type in Table 31-1:
Preferred Block Length.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Step 2</u>. Measure the length of each property boundary and for
each measurement divide by the preferred block length spacing from Table
31-1.</p>
<p><img alt="Shape, rectangle Description automatically generated" src="media/image1.jpeg" style="width:3.925in;height:3.54097in"/><strong>PROPERTY
LINE LENGTH</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Step 3</u>. When a fractional number results, round the result
down to the nearest whole number.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Step 4</u>. When the result is less than two, but the boundary
exceeds the maximum block length (Table 31-2: Maximum Block Length), one
local street is required.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Where an odd-shaped parcel has a series of
property line lengths shorter than the preferred block length, but
separate blocks would be required if the site was measured across (as
opposed to along the boundary segments), then a new street or streets
shall be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Where the extension of non-local and adjacent
local streets creates a street network that meets the required number of
blocks, no additional new streets are required. However, if the distance
from a parcel boundary to the nearest adjacent street exceeds the
maximum block length in Table 31-2, then a new street or streets shall
be required unless the SSI Administrator determines that a new street or
streets are infeasible due to factors such as significant topographical
constraints, unusual site-specific conditions related to the land,
significant utility constraints, design of the existing street network,
and location of existing driveways.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> New collector and local streets, if required,
shall be located to create the blocks calculated in this section,
including any required street stubs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Align where possible, with existing streets or
existing driveways to create four-way intersections.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> All new development should provide for more than
one access for ingress and egress at the time of development, if
feasible.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> New street stubs shall be public and shall not
be required to stub to existing lots if the SSI Administrator, in
consultation with CDOT, determines that the size or shape of the lot
makes a future street extension infeasible and/or of little functional
value.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> The average block length, when measured from
centerline to centerline, for an entire site shall not exceed the
maximum block length in Table 31-2. No individual block length created
by the addition of a new street, except in the Parks and Preserves or
Manufacturing and Logistics Place Types, shall exceed 1,000 feet. In the
Parks and Preserves Place Type, no individual block length shall exceed
1,500 feet. In the Manufacturing and Logistics Place Type no individual
block length shall exceed 2,000 feet.</p>
<p><strong>C. Internal Connectivity</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Once the external connectivity has been
established, the external streets shall be connected to create an
internal network.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The average block length, when measured from
centerline to centerline, for an entire site shall not exceed the
maximum block length in Table 31-2. No individual block length, except
in the Parks and Preserves or Manufacturing and Logistics Place Types,
shall exceed 1,000 feet. In the Parks and Preserves Place Type, no
individual block length shall exceed 1,500 feet. In the Manufacturing
and Logistics Place Type no individual block length shall exceed 2,000
feet. Exceptions to the maximum individual block length may be allowed
as noted in item D below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> The average block length for an entire site,
measured from street centerline to street centerline, shall not exceed
the maximum block length shown in Table 31-2: Maximum Block Length.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The following streets are not included in the
calculation for average block length:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Cul-de-sac streets.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Street stubs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Streets whose length is determined by the depth
of an individual or back-to-back residential lots.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Exceptions to the maximum individual block length
may be allowed as noted in Item D below. When an exception for the
maximum individual block length has been granted in the Parks and
Preserves Place Type, the length of the block will be included in the
block averaging calculation based on its length or 1,500 feet, whichever
is smaller. When an exception for the maximum individual block length
has been granted in the Manufacturing and Logistics Place Type, the
length of the block will be included in the block averaging calculation
based on its length or 2,000 feet, whichever is smaller. For all other
Place Types, when an exception has been granted for the maximum
individual block length, the length of the block will be included in the
block averaging calculation based on its length or 1,000 feet, whichever
is less.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="media/image2.png" style="width:5.14861in;height:3.51042in"/><strong>STREETS
ELIGIBLE FOR BLOCK AVERAGING CALCULATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>D. Exceptions to Block Lengths</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The SSI Administrator, in consultation with CDOT,
may modify the maximum individual block length, eliminating the need for
a street stub or paper street when any of the following conditions
exist:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A man-made physical barrier to a connection
exists, such as a freeway, railroad line, rapid transit line, or gas
pipeline.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> A natural physical barrier exists, such as areas
of steep slopes, wetlands, floodplain, creeks, or streams.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> An industrial use is located adjacent to a
proposed residential property, allowing future traffic to said
industrial use to traverse the residential property to reach a non-local
street.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> The shape of the property does not allow the
requirements to be met.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> There are right-of-way, sight distance, or access
constraints to providing the recommended spacing.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong> Accessibility to the subject property or an
adjacent property requires modification of the spacing requirements.</p>
<p><strong>g.</strong> Manufacturing, distribution, warehousing,
industrial, or security functions do not allow the spacing requirements
to be met. Block lengths in the Manufacturing and Logistics Place Type
may extend beyond a 2,000 feet individual block length to accommodate
for the design of buildings exceeding that length.</p>
<p><strong>h.</strong> It is advantageous to the street network to align
a new street with an existing street, major driveway, or traffic
signal.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Public parks may, in lieu of providing new
streets, provide off-street public paths. This exception does not apply
for new arterials and limited access streets indicated on the City of
Charlotte Streets Map.</p>
<p><strong>E. Block Widths</strong></p>
<p>Block widths shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots except
where a single tier of lots will facilitate nonresidential development,
the separation of nonresidential and residential developments, or the
separation of residential development from arterials.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture containing text, businesscard Description automatically generated" src="media/image3.png" style="width:3.32917in;height:1.97847in"/><img alt="A picture containing text, businesscard Description automatically generated" src="media/image4.png" style="width:3.47014in;height:2.07431in"/><strong>BLOCK
WIDTHS</strong></p>


<p><strong>F. Street Offsets</strong></p>
<p>Where there is an offset in the alignment of a street across an
intersection, the offset of the centerlines shall conform to the
standards of the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM).
The SSI Administrator, in consultation with CDOT, may modify this
requirement based on analysis of safety and operational conditions.</p>
<p><strong>G. Cul-De-Sacs and Dead-End Streets</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Cul-de-sacs and other permanent dead-ends on
public or network-required private streets are subject to SSI
Administrator approval and shall only be allowed when supporting
documentation shows either:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A natural or man-made barrier, such as a
waterway, railroad, any portion of a Rapid Transit Corridor alignment
that has been adopted by the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC),
limited-access expressway, or unusual topography exists which prevents
connection; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> When a connection is infeasible due to the site
design or land use of abutting property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than the
preferred street spacing in Table 31-1.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> A pedestrian and bicycle connection through a
cul-de-sac shall be required in the following instances:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> When a vehicular connection is impractical, or
when environmental conditions make a vehicular connection impractical;
or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> When a new pedestrian and bicycle connection
through a cul-de-sac would connect to an existing pedestrian and bicycle
pathway.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The requirement for a pedestrian and bicycle
connection through a cul-de-sac, and the associated standards in Section
33.4.C, may be modified or eliminated if the developer/owner can
document, and it can be confirmed by the Planning Department in
consultation with CDOT, that there are significant topographical or
unusual conditions related to the land.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> No cul-de-sacs are permitted for properties that
are within a ½ mile walk of an existing rapid transit station and zoned
IMU, NC, CAC-1, CAC-2, RAC, TOD-TR, TOD-NC, TOD-CC, or TOD-UC. In
addition, no cul-de-sacs are permitted for any property zoned UC or
UE.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Permanent dead-end streets shall provide for
vehicular turn-around mobility consistent with CLDSM standards.</p>
<p><strong>H. Partial Streets</strong></p>
<p>On a lot that abuts an existing partial street with new construction
of a principal building, the project shall construct the remainder of
the partial street. New partial streets shall meet the standards of
Tables 34-2 and 34-4.</p>
<p><strong>I.</strong> <strong>Traffic Calming</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Wherever a street exceeds the maximum block length provided in Table
31-2, the following conditions shall apply:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong>  For residential wide or office/commercial wide,
provide at least one pair of midblock curb extensions, as described in
the CLDSM, or another approved slow point.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong>  For all other street types, the developer shall
consult with the SSI Administrator about the possible use of other
traffic calming devices as available in the CLDSM, or as approved by the
CDOT Director.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">For traffic calming desired on streets not exceeding the maximum
block length the developer shall receive approval from the SSI
Administrator, in consultation with CDOT, for use of traffic calming
devices as available in the CLDSM, or as approved by the CDOT
Director.</p>
<h2>31.2 CROSS-ACCESS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Purpose and Intent</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Cross-access provides direct access between
adjacent parcels in order to improve connectivity so that motorists
and/or pedestrians do not need to reenter arterial streets in order to
gain access to an adjacent site, or to provide safer multi-modal
mobility, as determined by the CDOT Director.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Cross-access between adjacent properties reduces
vehicular conflicts between motorists on public streets and motorists
entering and leaving driveways. Reduced traffic conflicts result in
fewer accidents and improved traffic flow on the public streets. The
intent of this section is to provide for cross-access between adjacent
parcels in order to reduce the number of vehicular trips from arterial
streets and improve multi-modal mobility, thereby improving safety for
all modes.</p>
<p><strong>B. Parcels Requiring Cross-Access</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Abutting parcels which each front on an arterial
street shall provide cross-access between the parcels when the following
conditions occur:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Subdivision as defined by Section 30.3.A; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Construction of a new principal structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> When a parcel fronting either a collector or a
local street abuts a corner lot which has frontages on both the
collector or local street and an arterial street, both parcels shall
provide cross-access to each other when either actions listed in items
B.1.a or B.1.b above occur.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> If an abutting parcel is undeveloped or does not
currently have cross-access, a cross-access stub connection shall be
constructed in order to provide for a future cross-access
connection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Cross-access requirements, and the associated
standards found in Section 33.5, may be modified or eliminated by the
CDOT Director when it is determined that:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> A significant obstruction exists due to a
significant natural feature or existing infrastructure; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Significant topographical differences between
abutting parcels prevents potential cross-access connections; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Existing site conditions make cross-access
infeasible and/or present other safety and security factors that give
little functional value to cross-access; or</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> All on-site parking is located within a parking
structure and all vehicular access leads directly to the parking
structure; or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> As provided in Section 32.2.A, the required
cross-access is not related to the proposed development’s anticipated
transportation impacts or is not roughly proportional to those
anticipated impacts.</p>
<p><strong>C. Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>The following are excepted from cross-access requirements:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Residential development on properties in the
N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, N1-D, or N1-E Zoning Districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Development activities in the Parks and Preserves
Place Type, the Manufacturing and Logistics Place Type, the Regional
Activity Center Place Type located within the I-277 loop, and the
TOD-CC, TOD-NC, and TOD-UC Zoning Districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Connections between sites in the Manufacturing
and Logistics Place Type and sites in the Neighborhood 1 Place Type or
Neighborhood 2 Place Type.</p>
<p><strong>D. Easements</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> A cross-access easement shall be recorded on the
final plat for property involving a subdivision or recorded by separate
instrument when no plat is proposed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Property owners subject to cross-access
requirements are responsible for maintaining safe and useable
cross-access conditions for pedestrians and vehicles on their site.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Cross-access connections shall not be blocked or
obstructed in such a way as to prevent intended pedestrian and vehicular
traffic during agreed upon times of access.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Applicants are not required to seek cooperation
or permission from the adjacent property owner(s).</p>
<h2>31.3 DRIVEWAYS AND STREET ACCESS</h2>
<p><strong>A. Plan Approval Required</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> No driveway to a public street or
network-required private street shall be constructed, relocated, or
altered without a plan approval by CDOT. Access to a North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT) maintained street or roadway shall
also require an NCDOT Driveway Permit. Single-family uses are exempt
from obtaining a driveway plan approval but shall comply with the
Charlotte Streets Manual (Streets Manual) and CLDSM and item B.1.c.
below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> All driveway design, placement, and construction
shall comply with the Streets Manual and CLDSM.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Driveway plan approval shall be required for
existing driveways when any of the below actions occur. Any approved
driveway plan may also require associated improvements to the driveway
itself, the site, and/or roadways.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Subdivision as defined per Section 30.3.A; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Construction of a new principal structure; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Change of use for a structure of 5,000 square
feet or more in gross floor area or change of use that creates more than
20 additional daily trips; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Expansion of an existing building by 1,000 square
feet; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> Changes to on-site parking layout or on-site
circulation.</p>
<p><strong>B. Access Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Driveway Location and Placement</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> An approved driveway location and access shall be
determined based upon the Streets Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Driveways shall be in a location with limited
negative impact on the traffic flow and operations of the street.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Driveways shall be in a location that does not
conflict with or negatively impact the storm drainage system. If other
standards require driveway placement in a location such that the storm
drainage system would be negatively impacted, the developer is
responsible for making alterations to the storm drainage system to
mitigate or eliminate the impact. See Section 24.3.A.2 for additional
drainage requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Driveways near an un-signalized intersection
shall be located a minimum of 75 feet from the intersection. CDOT may
reduce this requirement based on analysis of safety and operational
conditions of the intersection or for driveways serving individual
dwellings and driveways serving duplex, triplex, or quadraplex
buildings.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> Driveways near a signalized intersection shall be
located a minimum of 200 feet from the intersection. CDOT may reduce
this requirement based on analysis of safety and operational conditions
of the intersection or for driveways serving individual dwellings and
driveways serving duplex, triplex, or quadraplex buildings.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>f.</strong> CDOT may require existing driveway(s) to be
relocated or closed in conjunction with any of the activities pursuant
to item A.3 above. Required new curb, amenity zone/planting strip,
and/or sidewalk/shared-use path shall be provided where the driveway(s)
was previously located. Where sidewalk is added and new or relocated
sidewalk is not required along an entire frontage, per Article 32,
sidewalk shall be located according to the standards of Article 33 or
shall match the adjacent sidewalk along the parcel frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>g.</strong> An existing curb cut may be relocated to a new
location approved by CDOT if the existing curb cut is eliminated, new
curb is constructed, and an amenity zone/planting strip and
sidewalk/shared-use path is provided where the driveway was previously
located.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>h.</strong> A new driveway is prohibited for an existing
development that already has access to a street from an existing
driveway, unless CDOT determines there is a significant operational or
circulation issue.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Access Restrictions</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Plan approval may include imposing driveway
access restrictions that limit vehicular movements to less than
full-movement in order to provide safe and efficient street
operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Driveway access shall be limited to less than
full movement under any of the following conditions:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The proposed access location is within 200 feet
of a signalized intersection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The proposed access location is within the
physical limits of existing or future single or dual left-turn
lanes.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The proposed access is near an intersection or
street section where a safety and/or street operations problem
exists.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> The proposed access does not meet sight distance
requirements of item D below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Other circumstances where full movement at the
proposed access location will negatively impact safe and efficient
street operations, as determined by CDOT.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> CDOT may reduce access restrictions based on
analysis of safety and operational conditions.</p>
<p><strong>C. Driveway Alignment and Internal Access</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Channelization and design of internal access
shall comply with the Streets Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The angle of a driveway intersection with the
public or network-required private street shall be 90 degrees. A reduced
angle of no less than 75 degrees may be approved by CDOT if any of the
following conditions exist:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Topographical challenges.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Natural features.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Existing right-of-way constraints.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Existing building(s) to remain.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> New driveways shall align with existing streets
and existing driveways where possible to create four-way
intersections.</p>
<p><strong>D. Sight Distance</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. General</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> All driveways shall provide sight distance as
described in the Streets Manual.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> All driveways shall meet American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Intersection Sight
Distance Requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Required Sight Triangles at Public Street
Intersections</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The standards below regulate sight triangles for intersections of
public streets, network-required private streets, and Type III driveways
with connections to public streets.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Dimension of Sight Triangles</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">A sight triangle applies to land abutting these intersections as
follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> A sight triangle bounded on two sides by curb,
measured in each direction along the back of curb for 50 feet from the
midpoint of the radius of the back of curb, and on the third side by a
diagonal line connecting the ends of each measured 50 foot side. Where
there is no curb, the pavement edge shall be used for these
measurements.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> In addition to the above, in other than 90
degree intersections or where grades mandate, the Charlotte Department
of Transportation (CDOT) may impose additional sight triangles under the
standards adopted by the American Association of State Highway
Transportation Officials (AASHTO).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="media/image6.png" style="width:3.89028in;height:3.01389in"/><strong>SIGHT
TRIANGLE AT PUBLIC STREET INTERSECTION</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Restrictions for Sight Triangles at Public Street
Intersections</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Within established sight triangles, no structure, sign, parking
space, landscaping, tree, berm, fence, wall, or other object of any kind
shall be installed, constructed, set out, or maintained so as to
obstruct visibility at a level between 30 and 72 inches above the level
of the center of the intersection.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Exceptions</strong> <strong>to
Restrictions for Sight Triangles at Public Street
