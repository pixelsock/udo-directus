ML-1, ML-2</strong></p>
<h2>8.1 PURPOSE</h2><h2>8.2 USES</h2><h2>8.3 DIMENSIONAL AND DESIGN STANDARDS</h2><h2>8.4 SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS</h2>
<h2>8.1 PURPOSE</h2>
<p><strong>A. ML-1 Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning
District</strong></p>
<p>The ML-1 Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning District is intended to
accommodate a range of warehouse/distribution and light industrial uses,
including a variety of light manufacturing and assembly. The ML-1 Zoning
District includes significant screening and buffering requirements to
ensure adequate separation and mitigation of potential impacts on
surrounding areas. Limited restaurant, retail, and personal service uses
to accommodate area workers are also allowed in the zoning district. The
ML-1 Zoning District is generally located in areas readily accessible by
arterials and interstates, as well as freight rail.</p>
<p><strong>B. ML-2 Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning
District</strong></p>
<p>The ML-2 Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning District is intended to
accommodate industrial uses, including those uses that may be hazardous
or noxious. Such uses may have significant external impacts and may
include large areas of outdoor storage or operation. The ML-2 Zoning
District includes significant screening and buffering requirements to
ensure adequate separation and mitigation of potential impacts on
surrounding areas. The ML-2 Zoning District is generally located in
areas readily accessible by arterials and interstates, as well as
freight rail.</p>
<h2>8.2 USES</h2>
<p>Article 15 lists permitted, temporary, and accessory uses for the
Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning Districts. Use definitions are found
in Article 15. Prescribed conditions applicable to certain principal
uses, temporary uses, and accessory uses are also found in Article
15.</p>
<h2>8.3 DIMENSIONAL AND DESIGN STANDARDS</h2>
<p><strong>A. General</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The tables below include the dimensional and
design standards for the Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning Districts.
Standards within the tables below may contain specific regulations
organized by frontage type (Section 3.5).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Where this Ordinance refers to frontages in
general, transit station, off-street public path, public park shall not
be considered a frontage within the Manufacturing and Logistics Zoning
Districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> In the tables below, where a cell contains a
standard or a “✔” the standard is applicable. Where a cell is blank and
shaded, the standard does not apply.</p>

<p><strong>B. Lot</strong></p>
<p>Lot standards govern the basic dimensions of lots, including but not
limited to minimum area, width, and coverage as applicable. These
standards are intended to provide a rational basis for the division,
organization, and development of land within the City of Charlotte.</p>
