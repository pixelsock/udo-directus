<h2>22.4 SIGN PERMIT</h2>
<p><strong>A. Authority</strong></p>
<p>Unless specifically stated in this article or this Ordinance that a
sign is exempt from permit requirements, the installation, construction,
enlargement, movement, or replacement of any sign requires a sign permit
from the Planning Department.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The outdoor advertising signs listed in Section
22.10 shall obtain all applicable permits as required by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).</p>
<p><strong>B. Approval Procedure</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Upon the filing of an application for a sign
permit, the Planning Department shall examine the plans and
specifications within 15 business days. If deemed necessary, they may
inspect the premises where the sign will be installed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> If an application for a proposed sign is complete
and complies with all the requirements of these regulations and other
applicable codes, including but not limited to Historic District
Commission (HDC) Design Guidelines, a permit shall be issued.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> A sign permit issued in accordance with this
article automatically becomes null and void if work has not visibly
started within six months of the date of issue, or if the work
authorized by it has been suspended or abandoned for one year.</p>
<p><strong>C. Fees</strong></p>
<p>To obtain a sign permit, all fees, in accordance with the associated
fee schedule, shall be paid.</p>
<p><strong>D. Final Inspection</strong></p>
<p>Upon notification of completion by the permit holder, the City and
County shall make a final inspection of the sign to verify conformance
with the permit and all applicable codes.</p>
<h2>22.5 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES</h2>
<p><strong>A. Calculation of Sign Area</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The sign area includes the area within a single,
continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of characters,
lettering, logos, illustration, or ornamentations, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the display or
differentiating the sign from the background to which it is placed.
Structural supports with no sign copy shall not be included in the sign
area. If a sign is attached to an entrance wall or fence, only that
portion of that wall or fence onto which the sign face or letters are
placed shall be calculated in the sign area.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img src="media/image1.png" style="width:5.35417in;height:2.74444in"/><strong>MEASUREMENT OF SIGN
AREA</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> For calculating maximum area of window signs, the
window area is calculated as a continuous surface until divided by an
architectural or structural element. Mullions are not considered an
element that divides window area. The area of a window sign is
calculated by the same method as for other sign areas, per Item 1 above.
The standards below further apply to the calculation of window sign
areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Shadowbox design within display windows, where
the window display is designed with a background enclosure within two
feet of the window against which signs are mounted that block views into
the establishment, is considered a window sign and the entire area of
the shadowbox is subject to the maximum sign area limitation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Perforated window graphics/window clings, which
show an image to the outside but allow those on the interior to view
outside, are not considered transparent and the entirety of the graphic
is counted as a window sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img src="media/image3.png" style="width:4.94653in;height:2.86944in"/><strong>MEASUREMENT OF WINDOW
SIGN AREA</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. Measurement of Sign Height</strong></p>
<p>Sign height is measured from the base of the sign at the ground to
the highest point of the sign, including any attachments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img src="media/image4.png" style="width:4.47847in;height:2.58056in"/><strong>MEASUREMENT OF SIGN
HEIGHT</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Measurement of Vertical Clearance</strong></p>
<p>For building-mounted signs, vertical clearance is measured as the
vertical distance measured from the ground directly below the sign to
the lowest point of the sign.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="media/image5.png" style="width:3.74444in;height:2.87361in"/><strong>MEASUREMENT
OF VERTICAL CLEARANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>D. Determination of Number of Sign Faces</strong></p>
<p>Signs are considered double-faced if the faces are positioned
relative to one another at an internal angle not exceeding 45 degrees.
The sign area for a double-faced sign is calculated as the measurement
of one sign face. If the internal angle exceeds 45 degrees, sign area is
calculated as the sum of both faces. This applies to all signs except
those located on corner lots, in which case the internal angle for a
double-faced sign may not exceed 90 degrees. In all cases, this
measurement refers to the internal angle of sign faces on a single
structure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image6.png" style="width:3.80764in;height:2.76528in"/><strong>MEASUREMENT OF SIGN
FACES (ANGLED SIGN) – CORNER LOT</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>MEASUREMENT OF SIGN FACES (ANGLED SIGN) – INTERIOR
LOT</strong></p>

<p><strong>E. Sign Setback</strong></p>
<p>A required sign setback is measured from the applicable lot line to
the closest component of the sign or sign structure.</p>

<p>No sign shall obstruct a required sight triangle or a required sight
distance, as described in Section 31.3.D.</p>
<p><strong>D. Projection into City Right-of-Way</strong></p>
<p>When a sign extends into a right-of-way, prior review and approval by
the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) and/or other relevant
agencies is required. The encroachment of signs into a right-of-way
requires an encroachment agreement from CDOT, if applicable. Adherence
to the design standards included in this article does not imply approval
through an encroachment agreement.</p>
<p><strong>E. Tree Protection</strong></p>
<p>Sign placement, including projections from a building facade, shall
protect all trees as required by Article 20 as well as any trees located
in the public right-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>F. Permitted Materials for Signs</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Permanent sign structures shall be constructed of
brick, wood or simulated wood, stone, concrete, metal, plastic, or
high-density urethane (HDU) foam board or similar durable foam
construction.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Awning, canopy, projecting, light pole banner,
banners, and wall signs may also be constructed of durable weather

<p><strong>G. Audio Components</strong></p>
<p>Audio components are prohibited as part of any sign, except for the
following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> Drive-through sign: For drive-through signs, the
audio component shall be designed, located, shielded, and directed to
prevent detection from surrounding properties.</p>
<p><strong>H. Changeable Message</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The following sign types, when allowed within a
zoning district, may have a changeable message component: wall sign,
projecting sign, ground sign, or marquee sign. Electronic signs are
limited to the zoning districts listed in Section 22.9.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> Where a sign has an electronic message or manual
changeable copy component, it is limited to a maximum of 50% of the
total area of the sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> For properties located within the I-277 loop, an
electronic message or manual changeable copy component may comprise 100%
of the total area of a sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> A sign structure with a changeable message
component shall contain additional copy; it cannot be a blank sign
structure once the changeable message component is discounted. This
provision does not apply to signs located within the I-277 loop and
comprised entirely of a changeable message component.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" src="media/image12.png" style="width:3.71111in;height:3.01736in"/><strong>CHANGEABLE
MESSAGE SIGN</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. Illumination Standards</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> All sign illumination, both external and
internal, shall be designed, located, shielded, and directed to prevent
the casting of glare or direct light upon rights-of-way and surrounding
properties, and prevent the distraction of motor vehicle operators or
pedestrians in the rights-of-way.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The sign face of internally illuminated signs
shall function as a filter to diffuse illumination. The sign face shall
cover all internal illumination components so that no exposed bulbs are
visible.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> All external illumination of a sign shall
concentrate the illumination upon the printed area of the sign face.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.</strong> Sign illumination shall not be combined with
reflective materials, such as mirrors, polished metal, or highly-glazed
tiles, which would increase glare.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5.</strong> Strobe lights, moving or fixed searchlights, and
floodlights/spotlights are prohibited, except in the UC Zoning District,
where such lighting is permitted.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6.</strong> No lighting, including neon or LED components of
signs, may flash, except in the UC Zoning District, where such lighting

the UC Zoning District, where such lighting may chase, blink or
flash.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8.</strong> The maximum allowable footcandle at the lot line
is one footcandle unless a sign extends over the lot line, where the
maximum of one footcandle is measured at the back of curb. This does not
apply</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">to electronic message signs, which are regulated by Item 9 below.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9.</strong> For electronic message signs, excluding
electronic outdoor advertising signs, the maximum brightness is limited
to 5,000 nits when measured from the sign’s face at its maximum
brightness, during daylight hours, and 500 nits when measured from the
sign’s face at its maximum brightness between dusk and dawn (i.e., the
time of day between sunset and sunrise). The sign shall have an ambient
light meter and automatic or manual dimmer control that produces a
distinct illumination change from a higher allowed illumination level to
a lower allowed level for the time period between one-half hour before
sunset and one-half hour after sunrise. Electronic outdoor advertising
signs are regulated by Section 22.10 below.</p>
<p><strong>J. Maintenance of Signs</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> All signs shall be maintained in good condition.
Deficiencies such as chipped paint, broken plastic, missing letters, and
exposed light bulbs are evidence of a lack of maintenance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> The City may remove any sign that is an immediate
public peril to persons or property summarily and without notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.</strong> Sign frames shall not remain unfilled and/or
allow any internal part or element of the sign structure to be visible.
Sign frames filled or replaced with a blank panel are considered to meet
this standard.</p>

<p><strong>B. Development Flexibility Option</strong></p>
<p>For providing flexibility and incentives for coordinated,
well-designed sign systems for large scale development, special
provisions varying the standards of these regulations may be approved by
the Planning Director subject to the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.</strong> The development is a residential, nonresidential,
or mixed-use development, 25 acres or greater in size, or 150 units for
multi-family developments, or containing more than 325,000 square feet
of nonresidential uses.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.</strong> A master sign program that includes the following
information is submitted:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Detailed designs of all proposed signs, including
the size, height, and materials of such signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Proposed locations and number of proposed
signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Sign illumination plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Plans for landscape or architectural features to

Parkway, or Arterial (except Main Street), where the height may be
increased up to 16 feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Subject to the sign criteria set out below, a
commercial or a mixed-use development containing over 500,000 square
feet of gross building area may have additional ground signs at the
pedestrian entrances into the building(s). Such signs are not considered
to be ground signs along a street frontage and do not count towards the
maximum of three ground signs along a street frontage. Such signs are
subject to the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Each sign shall be located a minimum of 400 feet
from any street or other zoning district-specific frontage.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Each sign shall be located within 150 feet of a

<p><strong>C. Detached Signs Impacted by Government-Sponsored
Projects</strong></p>
<p>When a government-sponsored project requires either the relocation of
an existing ground sign or impairs the visibility of an existing ground
sign from the lane of travel adjacent to the sign, adjustments to the
ground sign location and standards may be requested in accordance with
the following.</p>
<p><strong>1. Relocation of a Sign Approved on a Conditional Site
Plan</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Relocation of a ground sign, whose location was
originally approved on a conditional site plan, may be requested if the
sign’s visibility from the adjacent travel lane is impacted by a
government-sponsored project, or if the project requires the relocation
of the sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> The requested new location is not required to be
a location shown on the approved conditional site plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Converting a Monument Sign to a Pole Sign</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Conversion of a monument sign may be requested if
the sign’s visibility from the adjacent travel lane is impacted by a
government-sponsored project.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Conversion to a pole sign may be requested even
if the zoning district or conditional site plan does not allow pole
signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Conversion to a pole sign shall only be
considered if the ground sign cannot be relocated to another location
that allows visibility from the adjacent travel lane.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Modification to the Maximum Height of a Sign</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Modification to the maximum allowed height of a
detached sign may be requested if the sign’s visibility from the
adjacent travel lane is impacted by a government-sponsored project.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Modification to the maximum allowed height may be
requested even if the height is greater than that allowed by a
conditional site plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Modification to the maximum allowed height shall
only be considered if the sign cannot be relocated to another location
that allows visibility from the adjacent travel lane.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> Modification to the maximum allowed height shall
only be considered if the increase is ten feet or less above the maximum
sign height permitted in the zoning district.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Approval and New Sign Permit Required</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> An application shall be submitted to the Planning
Department requesting the detached sign modification. The Planning
Director has the authority to approve or disapprove the application.
Considerations in granting approval include, but are not limited to, the
following:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Need for relocation due to the
government-sponsored project.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Loss of visibility from the adjacent lane of
travel.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Impact of relocated utility lines.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Purpose and intent of sign restrictions on
conditional site plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Topographical changes due to the
government-sponsored project.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> Unusual or unique circumstances.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vii.</strong> If the sign is proposed to be moved, has the
distance between the existing and proposed location been minimized.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>viii.</strong> If converting to a pole sign, has the
requested increase in the sign height been minimized.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ix.</strong> If increasing the maximum sign height, has the
increase in the proposed sign height been minimized.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>x.</strong> Consolidation of multiple individual signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>xi.</strong> All other sign standards of this article and the
zoning district in which the sign is located are met.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> If the application is approved, a new sign permit
is required for each sign.</p>
<p><strong>D. Landmark and Historic Signs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Designation Procedure</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> The property owner of the parcel where a proposed
landmark sign is located, or the owner of the site where a proposed
historic sign is to be relocated, may apply for designation of an
existing sign as a landmark or historic sign. Such application shall be
submitted on a form determined by the Planning Department. The Zoning
Administrator has the authority to approve or to disapprove the
designation of landmark or historic signs based upon the criteria stated
below. At the time of the filing of a landmark or historic sign
designation application, the applicant shall file all necessary
information for the Planning Department to determine if the sign meets
the criteria for the requested designation. The Zoning Administrator has
the authority to request whatever other information is necessary to make
a decision. The burden of proof for meeting the criteria is upon the
applicant.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> In approving or disapproving a landmark or
historic sign application, the Zoning Administrator shall state the
reasons in writing. An appeal of the decision to the UDO Board of
Adjustment shall be properly filed within 30 days of the date of the
decision as shown on the face of the decision.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Once a sign has been designated as a landmark or
historic sign, the Planning Department shall then issue a certificate to
the applicant stating that the sign has been duly designated as a
landmark or historic sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> If the sign being considered for landmark or
historic designation is associated with a designated local landmark or
located in an established Historic District, the Planning Department
shall receive a recommendation from the appropriate
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmark Commission or the Historic
District Commission before deciding.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>e.</strong> After a sign is designated as a landmark or
historic sign it shall be maintained in its original condition, shape,
and size, except for minor changes required for structural enhancements
or changes required to comply with minimum Building or Electrical Codes,
or to remove portions from a public right-of-way. Where original
materials are unavailable, substitute materials shall be used that are
as similar as possible to the original material.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>f.</strong> While a designated landmark or historic sign is
deemed conforming, this section is not intended to prevent the Planning
Department from enforcing this Ordinance if it, or another City agency,
determines that there is a violation of any provisions, or the intent
and purposes of any provisions of this Ordinance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>g.</strong> Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
owner(s) of a designated landmark or historic sign from removing such a
sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Landmark Signs</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The purpose of designating a sign as a landmark sign is to encourage
the restoration and retention of on-premise, nonconforming signs that
are historically significant.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Designation Criteria</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Planning Department may designate an existing on-premises sign as
a landmark sign if it meets the following criteria:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The sign has been in continuous existence at the
present location for at least 25 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The sign is an on-premises sign, which meets at
least four of the following criteria:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> It was expressly designed for the business,
institution, or other establishments at that location.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> It bears a national or local emblem, logo, or
other graphic that is unique to the property or the establishment.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> The sign exhibits unique or rare characteristics
that enhance the streetscape or identity of a neighborhood.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> The sign is significant as evidence of the
history of the product, business, or service advertised.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> The sign is characteristic of a specific
historic period.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> The sign is integral to the building’s design or
physical fabric.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(G)</strong> The sign represents an outstanding example of
the sign maker’s art due to craftsmanship, use of materials, or
design.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> The sign complies with the appropriate
provisions of the North Carolina State Building and Electrical Codes.
Such signs are allowed structural and electrical repairs, with the
approval of a sign permit, to meet the standards of such codes.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> If any portion of the sign is permitted to
remain in or over a City right-of-way, a CDOT encroachment agreement is
required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> The sign is structurally safe or is capable of
being made so without substantially altering its historical
significance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Location</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If a designated landmark sign is moved on-premise, it shall be
subject to the location standards of this article.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Historic Signs</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The restoration and retention of nonconforming, historically
significant signs that have been removed from their original locations
and are to be reused is encouraged. Allowing those signs to move to
other locations within the community is necessary to ensure
preservation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Designation Criteria</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Planning Department may designate an existing sign as a historic
sign if it meets the following criteria:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> The sign shall be at least 25 years old.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> The sign shall meet at least three of the
following criteria:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> It bears a national or local emblem, logo, or
other graphic that is unique to the community.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> The sign exhibits unique or rare characteristics
that enhance the streetscape or identity of a neighborhood.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> The sign is significant as evidence of the
history of the product, business, or service advertised.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> The sign is characteristic of a specific
historic period.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> The sign represents an outstanding example of
the sign maker’s art due to craftsmanship, use of materials, or
design.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> The sign complies with the appropriate
provisions of the North Carolina State Building and Electrical Codes.
Such signs are allowed structural and electrical repairs, with the
approval of a sign permit, to meet the standards of such codes.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(G)</strong> The sign is structurally safe or is capable of
being made so without substantially altering its historical
significance.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Location</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The sign may be moved to another location on the site where it is
currently located or to another property. It is encouraged that the sign
be relocated to a site within the neighborhood from which it originated.
The receiving site shall be located outside of a Neighborhood 1 Zoning
District or Neighborhood 2 Zoning District for commercial signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Nonconforming Aspects of Relocated Signs</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Relocated historic signs that are nonconforming
based on their size, height, or lighting do not have to be brought into
conformance. However, such signs shall not increase the degree of
nonconformity by any physical alterations to the sign that previously
rendered them nonconforming.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Sign lighting of relocated historic signs shall
be located, screened, or shielded so that abutting lots located in any
Neighborhood 1 Place Type and Neighborhood 2 Place Type are not directly
illuminated and do not cause glare or impair the vision of
motorists.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Projecting signs that extend beyond the maximum
projecting dimension based upon the existing dimension of the sign
require a CDOT encroachment agreement if they project into the city
right-of-way.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> The relocation of historic signs that are
considered prohibited by this article may maintain the prohibited
characteristic, provided such features are considered part of the
historic or cultural character of the sign and approved as part of the
designation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Relocated outdoor advertising signs shall comply
with only the following sections of Table 22-6: zoning district,
location, spacing, and tree-cutting regulations.</p>
<h2>22.12 PROHIBITED SIGNS</h2>
