<h2>32.1 COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION REVIEW (CTR)</h2>
<p><strong>A. Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Comprehensive Transportation Review (CTR) is to
identify the transportation improvements necessary to: mitigate
increased demand on transportation infrastructure by a proposed
development, preserve public investment in the transportation system,
and support the sustained growth and prosperity of an area. To
appropriately address multimodal and context-based impacts and
mitigations, the CTR includes three types of analyses, including
Multimodal Assessments, Transportation Demand Management (TDM), and
Traffic Impact Studies (TIS).</p>
<p><strong>B. Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The CTR, including specific thresholds and requirements, is included
in the Charlotte Streets Manual (Streets Manual). A CTR is required for
any development project that meets or exceeds any specified threshold.
The developer shall procure the CTR at their own expense, and the CTR
shall satisfy all applicable requirements.</p>
<p><strong>C. Mitigation</strong></p>
<p>Based on the results or recommendations of a CTR, the developer shall
provide any required mitigation and shall also abide by all applicable
CTR procedures and requirements in providing such mitigation. Any
mitigation required by the CTR shall be included along with all other
transportation requirements of the proposed development as required by
this Ordinance and other applicable law.</p>
<h2>32.2 TRANSPORTATION ADJUSTMENTS</h2>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Upon an applicant’s request, if the City
determines that one or more of the requirements identified in Table
32-1: Transportation Adjustments are unrelated to the proposed
development’s anticipated transportation impacts or are not roughly
proportional to those anticipated impacts, the City may modify or waive
one or more of those requirements to the extent necessary to make them
related to the proposed development’s anticipated transportation impacts
and roughly proportional to those anticipated impacts.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Table 32-1: Transportation Adjustments states the
sections for which adjustments can be requested, the standard that may
be adjusted, the official with authority to determine any adjustments to
be made, and any applicable provisions of the standards not eligible for
adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Upon an applicant’s request, if the City
determines that North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)
policy and standards prohibit specific elements of a street
cross-section required by the Charlotte Streets Map, the Charlotte
Department of Transportation (CDOT) Director may modify the required
street cross-section to the extent necessary to make to make the street
cross-section consistent with NCDOT policy and standards, if it is
determined that the resulting street cross-section elements can be
safely and functionally provided. Any modifications granted shall not
override the future curb line location as determined by the standards in
Article 33.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Any determinations and decisions pursuant to this
section may be appealed to the UDO Board of Adjustment as per Article
37.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Exceptions for New Curb and Gutter
Installation</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> When the cumulative built-upon area will be less
than 25% of the total area of the parcel, new curb and gutter may not be
required. However, the CDOT Director, in consultation with the
Stormwater Manager, may require certain improvements if the improvements
are determined to be needed for adequate drainage or to ensure public
safety.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> A fee may be required instead of installation of
any of the improvements included in this section if a funded Community
Investment Plan (CIP) project is in place that will construct the
required improvements to an existing street. Right-of-way dedication
shall still be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> For streets maintained by NCDOT, CDOT will
coordinate with NCDOT to determine whether curb and gutter is
required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Relocation of Existing Curb and Gutter</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Where existing curb and gutter is not located at
the required future back-of-curb location (see Table 34-1 as reference),
for both public and network-required private streets, relocation to the
future location is required when any of the following conditions
exist:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> A CTR as defined by Section 32.1 requires
relocation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> When land development approval requires turn
lanes that cannot be constructed to the standard without moving the
existing curb.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> When an exception for on-street waste
collection has been approved per Section 21.4.E.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Approval of a subdivision as defined by Section
30.3.A. (See exceptions in item b below.)</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> A new principal structure is constructed, except
for residential development on properties in an N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, N1-D,
or N1-E Zoning District. (See exceptions in item b below.)</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> A principal structure is expanded by 50% or
5,000 square feet, whichever is greater, except for expansion of a
residential structure on property in an N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, N1-D, or N1-E
Zoning District. (See exceptions in item b below.)</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The following exceptions apply to items a.iv,
a.v, and a.vi above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> For parcels located in the Neighborhood 2 Place
Type, Neighborhood Center Place Type, Community Activity Center Place
Type, Regional Activity Center Place Type, or Innovation Mixed-Use Place
Type, or zoned the IC-2 or RC Zoning District, the following exceptions
apply.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> <strong>Arterial Streets</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">If the property frontage is less than half the preferred block length
(Table 31-1), relocation of existing curb and gutter is not required
unless:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> The property frontage is within a distance equal
to or less than the preferred block length from a curb on the same side
of the street located per the Streets Map; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> The property frontage is within a distance equal
to or less than the preferred block length from a frontage that includes
existing bicycle facilities and/or on-street parking, if these
facilities are required for the subject parcel.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Collector and Local Streets</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">All properties are exempt, but on-street parking shall be prohibited
if there is not adequate space to accommodate it.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> For parcels located in the Neighborhood 1 Place
Type, Commercial Place Type, Manufacturing and Logistics Place Type, or
Parks and Preserves Place Type, or in the IC-1, OFC, or OG Zoning
District, the following exceptions apply.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A) Arterial Streets</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Relocation of existing curb and gutter is not required if any of the
following apply:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(1)</strong> The property frontage is less than the full
preferred block length (Table 31-1).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(2)</strong> The property frontage is located more than a
full preferred block length (Table 31-1) from a curb on the same side of
the street located per the Streets Map.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(3)</strong> The property frontage includes existing bicycle
facilities and/or on-street parking, if these facilities are required
for the subject parcel.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Collector and Local Streets</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">All properties are exempt, but on-street parking shall be prohibited
if there is not adequate space to accommodate it.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Additional exceptions are listed below.
However, any modifications granted from these exceptions shall not
override the future curb line location as determined by the standards in
Article 33.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Curb and gutter relocation may be waived if it
is determined by the CDOT Director that the required cross-section
elements can be safely and functionally provided in the interim with the
existing curb location.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> A fee may be required instead of relocation of
any of the improvements included in this section if a funded CIP project
will construct the required improvements to an existing street.
Right-of-way dedication shall still be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(C)</strong> On local and collector streets, curb and gutter
relocation may be waived if the required relocation will not accommodate
the preservation of any heritage trees and/or any City trees meeting
heritage tree criteria as defined by Article 20 that meet acceptable
standards for tree health, structural integrity, and risk level as
determined by the Chief Urban Forester. The CDOT Director, in
consultation with the Chief Urban Forester, shall determine any required
modifications.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(D)</strong> On arterials, the transportation facilities
necessitating the movement of the curb and gutter may be modified to
accommodate the preservation of heritage trees and/or any City trees
meeting heritage tree criteria as defined by Article 20 that meet
acceptable standards for tree health, structural integrity, and risk
level as determined by the Chief Urban Forester. However, if the
Planning Director, in consultation with the CDOT Director, determines
the accommodation cannot be safely and functionally implemented for a
critical transportation facility, the curb and gutter shall be
moved.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a required curb and gutter relocation will
significantly impede the safe and effective conveyance of storm water or
otherwise adversely affect storm drainage, the developer shall produce
engineering design plans for a solution to make curb and gutter
relocation feasible. If these plans demonstrate a construction scope
that will cause an unusual and unnecessary hardship on the applicant or
will otherwise be disproportional to the scale of the development, the
CDOT Director, in consultation with the Director of Stormwater Services,
may modify the requirement to relocate the curb and gutter.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(F)</strong> The requirement for relocation of curb and
gutter, and the location of the curb and gutter, may be modified if it
can be determined by CDOT in consultation with the Planning Department
and Stormwater Services, that significant topographical constraints,
unusual site-specific conditions related to the land, or significant
utility constraints make such improvements infeasible. Significant
utility constraints shall include high voltage transmission structures,
among others, as determined by CDOT in consultation with the utility
provider. CDOT may require documentation from the applicable utility
provider in order to modify the requirement to relocate the curb and
gutter.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Where existing curb and gutter is required to be
relocated, the associated sidewalk shall be located and designed
consistent with Article 33, street pavement shall be extended to the
relocated curb and gutter per CLDSM standards, and the associated
drainage per Section 34.1 shall be provided.</p>
<p><strong>D. Sidewalk and Amenity Zone/Planting Strip</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>New Streetscape</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> All new streetscape installations shall comply
with the requirements of Article 33 as well as with any other applicable
provisions of this UDO. All new streetscape elements shall be located
behind the future back of curb or, for Parkways, behind the
right-of-way, the required amenity zone or planting strip shall be
located between the future back of curb and the required sidewalk or
shared-use path. All newly constructed streetscape shall also comply
with any perimeter tree planting requirements as per the tree
regulations in Article 20.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Where there is no existing sidewalk/shared-use
path on public and network-required private streets, the required
sidewalk/shared-use path and amenity zone/planting strip shall be
provided when any of the below conditions exist:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> A CTR as defined by Section 32.1 requires
installation.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Approval of a subdivision as defined by Section
30.3.A.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Curb and gutter are required to be installed or
relocated by Section 32.7.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> A new principal structure is constructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> For an existing structure that is 1,500 square
feet or more in gross floor area when there is a change of use that:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Is from one use category to another use category
and that increases trips; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> Is to a transportation-intensive use within the
same use category (Table 32-2) and that increases trips.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> An existing building is expanded by 1,000 or
more square feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vii.</strong> Additional parking is added that requires a new
sidewalk in order to provide a complete pedestrian connection between
the parking area and the principal use of the parcel.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>viii.</strong> Outdoor dining of 1,000 or more square feet is
installed or outdoor dining is expanded by 1,000 or more square
feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The following exceptions to new streetscape
requirements apply:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Residential uses in the Neighborhood 1 Place Type
are exempt from items b.iv, b.vi, and b.vii above, except when part of
an approval of a new subdivision as defined by Section 30.3.A.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> A fee may be required instead of installation of
any of the improvements included in this section if a funded CIP project
is in place that will construct the required improvements to an existing
street. Right-of-way dedication shall still be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>d.</strong> The requirement to construct new streetscape and
the associated streetscape standards found in Article 33 may be modified
if it can be determined by the Planning Department, in consultation with
CDOT, that significant topographical constraints, unusual site-specific
conditions related to the land, or significant utility constraints make
such improvements infeasible. Significant utility constraints are
limited to the presence of high voltage transmission structures.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Existing Streetscape</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Existing sidewalks/shared-use paths and amenity
zones/planting strips on public and network-required private streets
shall be updated to meet current standards, including those of Article
33 and any other applicable provisions of this UDO, when any of the
below conditions exist. All updated streetscape shall be located behind
the future back of curb, and the required amenity zone or planting strip
shall be located between the future back of curb and the required
sidewalk or multi-use path. All updated streetscape shall also comply
with any perimeter tree planting requirements as per the tree
regulations in Article 20.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> A CTR as defined by Section 32.1 requires
streetscape updates.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Approval of a subdivision as defined by Section
30.3.A.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Curb and gutter are required to be installed or
relocated by Section 32.7.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> A new principal structure is constructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Sidewalks/shared-use paths are substandard when
they are two feet or more less than the required minimum width. Amenity
zones/planting strips are substandard if they are less than six feet in
width. Substandard sidewalks/shared-use paths and amenity zone/planting
strips shall be updated to meet current standards if any of the
following conditions exist:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> For an existing structure that is 5,000 square
feet or more in gross floor area when there is a change of use that:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(A)</strong> Is from one use category to another use category
and that increases trips, or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(B)</strong> Is to a transportation-intensive use within the
same use category (Table 32-2) and that increases trips; or</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> An existing building is expanded by 1,000 square
feet or more.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> Four or more parking spaces are added and the
additional parking requires a new sidewalk in order to provide a
complete pedestrian connection between the parking area and the
principal use of the property.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> Outdoor dining of 1,000 or more square feet is
installed or outdoor dining is expanded by 1,000 or more square
feet.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>v.</strong> Any development which removes any portion or
portions of substandard sidewalk along an arterial, greater than 30
linear feet, during construction shall be required to replace that
removed sidewalk with a sidewalk and planting strip that meets the
standards of Article 33.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>vi.</strong> Any development which removes or damages any
portion or portions of substandard sidewalk along an arterial street,
which amounts to more than 50% of that property's frontage width along
that arterial, shall be required to replace all substandard sidewalk
along that property's arterial frontage with a sidewalk and planting
strip that meets the standards of Article 33.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> The following exceptions apply to the
requirements to improve the existing streetscape:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>i.</strong> Residential uses in the Neighborhood 1 Place Type
are exempt from items a.iv and b.ii above for the following:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Development on collector and local streets.</p></li>
<li><p>Development of a single-family, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex
dwelling on an arterial street.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>ii.</strong> Nonresidential uses in the Neighborhood 1 Place
Type are exempt from items b.i, b.ii, and b.iii above for collector and
local frontages.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iii.</strong> A fee may be required instead of the required
improvements included in this section if a funded CIP project is in
place that will construct the required improvements to an existing
street. Right-of-way dedication shall still be required.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>iv.</strong> The requirement to update existing streetscape
and the associated streetscape standards found in Article 33 may be
modified if it can be determined by the Planning Department, in
consultation with CDOT, that significant topographical constraints,
unusual site-specific conditions related to the land, or significant
utility constraints make such improvements infeasible. Significant
utility constraints are limited to the presence of high voltage
transmission structures.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Streetscape Modifications for Tree
Preservation</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Chief Urban Forester, in consultation with the CDOT Director, may
modify the streetscape requirements and the associated streetscape
standards found in Article 33 to accommodate the preservation of trees
meeting acceptable standards for tree health, structural integrity, and
risk level as determined by the Chief Urban Forester. If a modification
to the location of the required sidewalk is necessary, then the location
of the required sidewalk shall be prioritized in descending order as
follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Sidewalk located between trees and building.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>b.</strong> Sidewalk located between curb and trees, with
substandard planting strip permitted.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>c.</strong> Sidewalk located at the back of curb, with an
additional foot of width added.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Sidewalk widths may be modified to no less than five feet. On
arterials with sidewalks located at back of curb, sidewalk widths may be
modified to no less than six feet. Modification for sidewalk location or
width shall be for the minimum length of sidewalk necessary to
accommodate the preservation of trees meeting acceptable standards for
tree health, structural integrity, and risk level as determined by the
Chief Urban Forester.</p>
<p><strong>4. Constrained Space</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The following constrained space standards shall be used where there
is less than the required space for a complete streetscape between the
face of an existing building that will not be replaced and the back of
curb.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>a.</strong> Where a sidewalk is required and there is ten
feet or more between the face of the building and the back of curb, the
available space shall be evenly divided between sidewalk and amenity
zone/planting strip. When less than ten feet is available between the
face of the building and the back of curb, see Table 32-3: Constrained
Space Division When Sidewalk Required to determine use of space.</p>
