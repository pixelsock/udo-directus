fields, driving ranges, and other similar uses are subject to the
following:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Recreational fields are permitted a total
luminaire height of 65 feet in any zoning district. Luminaires greater

<p><strong>b.</strong> All lighting shall be directed onto the field or
range.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The recreational field lighting shall be
extinguished one hour following the end of a scheduled event or the

<p><strong>16.4 AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCES</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the development allowances provided below is to
encourage the development of affordable housing within the City and the
ETJ.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Affordable housing developments that meet the
following requirements shall be permitted the additional development
allowances listed in item B below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Affordability period: 30 years</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Minimum units of affordable housing: Five
units</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Percentage of development (one of the
following):</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> 15% at 60% AMI; or</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> 30% at 80% AMI; or</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> 20% at 80% AMI in areas of high housing cost per
the UDO Zoning Administration Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Those affordable housing developments that meet
the requirements of item A above shall be permitted the following
development allowances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If zoned the N2-A Zoning District, to build to
the N2-B Zoning District standards.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If zoned the N2-C or NC Zoning District, to build
to the N2-A or N2-B Zoning District standards.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A new street, in whole or in part, shall not be
required, per Section 32.5, if that street or a portion of such street
does not provide access to the affordable housing development, as
determined by the SSI Administrator, and that street does not connect to
an existing street on an abutting property. In lieu of construction the
street or portion of such street, right-of-way shall be dedicated for
future construction of the street or portion of such street.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Projects may use Tier 1 Green Area Credits per
Section 20.15.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Where mitigation is required for removal of
heritage trees, planting of twice the number of required mitigation
trees shall be allowed in lieu of the mitigation fee per Article 20. The
mitigation trees may also be counted towards perimeter tree plantings
per Section 20.17.C when they meet all perimeter tree planting
requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Where 20% of units are provided at 60% AMI or
below for 15 years, with a minimum of five units of affordable housing,
costs related to construction of sidewalks required on public streets
per Section 32.7.D shall be reimbursed by the City. This provision shall
only apply within the corporate limits of the City of Charlotte and not

<p><strong>D.</strong> In the N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D Zoning
Districts, voluntary mixed-income residential developments per Section
4.5.B may receive a bonus allowing for the development of property in
accordance with the standards of the next zoning district of greater
intensity in exchange for setting aside affordable housing units.</p>
<p><strong>16.5 DESIGN OF ON-SITE OPEN SPACE</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Open Space Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> When required within the zoning district
regulations, open space shall meet the design requirements of Table
16-2: Design of Open Space, organized by type of open space.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Driveways, parking areas, required bicycle
parking areas, above ground utility areas, mailboxes, and landscape
yards do not count toward on-site open space requirements. However,
sidewalks that traverse a required open space area shall count towards
the minimum required open space.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The following may be counted toward open space
requirements when they meet the minimum requirements of this article and
any applicable articles listed below:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Amenitized tree areas per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> 50% of the open space may be tree save areas per
Article 20, so long as such tree save area abuts the remaining required
open space and includes allowed amenities to provide passive
recreation.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> A green roof per Article 20 that is designed to
allow passive recreation.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Internal trees per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> Water supply water quality buffer per Article
23.</p>
<p><strong>f.</strong> Post-construction water quality buffer per

Recreation.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The area used to calculate the required open
space does not include existing and dedicated street rights-of-ways,
utility easements, existing ponds and lakes, and railroad easements and
rights-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> When located within a required on-site open space
area, a commercial structure no greater than 500 square feet in gross
floor area or 10% of the total open space area, whichever is less, is
allowed and may be included in the calculation of total on-site open
space. The use of such commercial structure shall be a use allowed
within the zoning district as per the Use Matrix in Article 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Exemptions from Required On-Site Open Space</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Uses within the categories of Open Space,
Recreation, and Agricultural Uses, Infrastructure Uses, or
Transportation Uses in the Use Matrix in Article 15 are not required to
provide on-site open space.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Single-family, duplex, triplex, and quadraplex
dwellings are not required to provide on-site open space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Open Space Dedication and Fee-in-Lieu
Alternatives</strong></p>
<p>When open space is required within the zoning district regulations,
as an alternative to the required on-site open space, the property owner
may select one of the following options, or a combination thereof, per
the UDO Zoning Administration Manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Dedicate land required for on-site open space to
Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation, so long as the land meets Park
and Recreation standards. If selecting this option, and dedicating all
required on-site open space, the amount of open space dedicated may be
reduced by 10%.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Provide a fee-in-lieu of the required on-site
open space to Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation, so long as the fee
is accepted by Park and Recreation. The payment of such funds shall be
used to acquire or develop recreation areas in the surrounding area for
which the fee-in-lieu is paid.</p>
