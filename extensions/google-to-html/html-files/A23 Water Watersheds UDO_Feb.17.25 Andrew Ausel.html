<p><strong>23.1 PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Mountain Island Lake
Watershed</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Mountain Island Lake Watershed standards is to
provide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the
North Carolina Water Supply Watershed Classification and Protection Act
(N.C.G.S. §143-214.5) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Mountain Island Lake Watershed standards apply in any zoning district.
The Mountain Island Lake Watershed standards supplement the use
permissions and development standards of the base zoning district within
the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Protection Area to ensure protection
of public water supplies. All other uses and regulations for the base
zoning district remain in effect for properties within the Mountain
Island Lake Watershed.</p>
<p><strong>B. Lake Wylie Watershed</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Lake Wylie Watershed standards is to provide for
the protection of public water supplies as required by the North
Carolina Water Supply Watershed Classification and Protection Act
(N.C.G.S. §143-214.5) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Lake
Wylie Watershed standards apply in any base zoning district. The Lake
Wylie Watershed standards supplement the use permissions and development
standards of the base zoning district within the Lake Wylie Watershed
Protection Area to ensure protection of public water supplies. All other
uses and regulations for the base zoning district remain in effect for
properties within the Lake Wylie Watershed.</p>
<p><strong>C. Lower Lake Wylie Watershed</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Lower Lake Wylie Watershed standards is to support
the protection of Lake Wylie’s water quality and to provide protection
to public water supplies. The Lower Lake Wylie Watershed standards may
apply in any base zoning district. The Lower Lake Wylie Watershed
standards supplement the use permissions and development standards of
the base zoning district within the Lower Lake Wylie Watershed
Protection Area to ensure protection of public water supplies. All other
uses and regulations for the base zoning district remain in effect for
properties within the Lower Lake Wylie Watershed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Required Water Quality Buffer Width Increase</strong></p>
<p>Required minimum buffer width shall be increased by 50% for new
developments under the High-Density Option located along the lakeshore
that have average slopes equal to or greater than 50% within the 100
foot buffer. The average slope is calculated by measuring the slope from
the highest and lowest elevations at the 100 foot buffer to the 569.4
foot full pond elevation of Lake Wylie. The sum of the two measurements
is divided by two to determine the average slope within the 100 foot
buffer. The additional buffer area is applied in areas of the tract
where slopes are greatest to obtain the maximum benefit from the
increased buffer area.</p>
<p><strong>3. Shoreline Stabilization Required</strong></p>
<p>If a building permit is required for property improvement under the
High-Density Option, which will result in an increase in built-upon area
(BUA), shoreline stabilization is required as needed and allowed when
unstable shorelines are present, and as approved on a plan submitted to
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services (CMSWS) and as allowed by
Duke Energy Lake Services.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Mitigation</strong></p>
<p>Unless exempted below, water quality buffer impacts are allowed only
with the approval of a site-specific mitigation plan by CMSWS and/or
approval of a variance per Article 37, if a variance is required. The
following techniques are available for mitigation. Specifications for
these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided in the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Water Quality Buffer Implementation
Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> <strong>Installation of Stormwater Control
Measures (SCMs)</strong></p>
<p>If not required by another City ordinance or regulation of this
Ordinance, the installation of an on-site SCM designed to achieve
specified pollutant removal targets will allow for water quality buffer
impacts on the specific site. The SCM should remain outside the Stream
Side Zone if practical. A detailed SCM design plan shall be submitted to
CMSWS for approval based on specifications and pollutant removal targets
contained in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Stormwater Control Measure Design
Manual (SCM Design Manual). This plan shall also include a long-term
maintenance strategy for the SCM complete with the establishment of
adequate financing to support the proposed maintenance practices.</p>
<p><strong>b. Water Quality Buffer Restoration</strong></p>
<p>The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of
equivalent or greater drainage area, the condition of which is
determined to be qualified for restoration by CMSWS. This restored
buffer area shall be equal or greater in size than the buffer area to be
mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>c. Water Quality Buffer Preservation</strong></p>
<p>The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at
equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and
convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the City of
Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, or approved conservation organization.
Staff may consider other means for preserving these areas on a
case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>d. Mitigation Credits</strong></p>
<p>The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing area of
water quality buffer impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as
established by CMSWS shall allow for water quality buffer impacts on the
specific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any other program
(i.e., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement
unless the issuing agency agrees to relinquish the funds to CMSWS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>D. Additional Water Quality Buffer Requirements (All
Watersheds)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> No permanent structures, built upon areas, septic
systems, or any other disturbance of existing vegetation is allowed
within the water quality buffer except as follows:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> No trees larger than a two-inch caliper are to be
removed except for dead or diseased trees. Trees less than a two-inch
caliper and undergrowth may be removed to be replaced by an effective
stabilization and filtering groundcover based upon the
“Charlotte-Mecklenburg Water Quality Buffer Implementation
Guidelines.”</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Stream bank or shoreline stabilization is allowed
as approved on a plan submitted to CMSWS.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Water dependent structures and public projects,
such as transportation crossings, public utilities, and greenway paths,
are allowed where no practical alternative exists. These activities
should minimize built-upon area, direct runoff away from surface waters,
and maximize the utilization of nonstructural BMPs and pervious
materials.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Non-impervious recreational development and
non-impervious pedestrian trails may be allowed in the required water
quality buffer if located a minimum of 30 feet from the stream bank.
This provision does not apply to the Mountain Island Lake Watershed
Critical Areas.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The following may be located within water supply
water quality buffers when they meet the minimum requirements of this
article and the articles listed below:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Required open space per Article 16.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Landscape yard per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Amenitized tree areas per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Tree save per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> Internal trees per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>f.</strong> Perimeter trees per Article 20.</p>
<p><strong>g.</strong> Water supply water quality buffer per Article
23.</p>
<p><strong>h.</strong> Post-construction water quality buffer per
Article 25.</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> SWIM water quality buffer per Article 26.</p>
<p><strong>j.</strong> Floodplain per Article 27.</p>
<p><strong>k.</strong> Areas for greenways or parks per Article 32
offered for dedication and accepted by Mecklenburg County Park and
Recreation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>23.7 HIGH-DENSITY OPTION</strong></p>
<p>The High-Density Option allows for a greater development density,
provided SCMs are installed.</p>
<p><strong>A. High-Density Development Permit Application</strong></p>

required for new development exceeding the threshold of the Low-Density
Option.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Application for a High-Density Development Permit
shall be submitted as follows:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> For development plans subject to subdivision
(Article 30) and soil erosion and sedimentation control (Article 28) and
reviewed by the Planning Department, the High-Density Development Permit
shall be submitted to the Subdivision, Streets, and Infrastructure
Administrator (SSI Administrator), as part of the subdivision review
application process.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> For development plans not subject to the
subdivision (Article 30), the High-Density Development Permit shall be
submitted to CMSWS as part of the sediment and erosion control
requirements of the building permit application process.</p>
